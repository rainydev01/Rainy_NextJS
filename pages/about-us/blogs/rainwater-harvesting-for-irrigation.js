                            <p>
                            With intensive agriculture spreading throughout India there is this urgent need to encourage rainwater harvesting for irrigation. The greatest benefit of this system is it can help eliminate the current unsustainable ways of extracting groundwater for agricultural use. And with Rainy Filters to guide you, rainwater harvesting for irrigation will no longer be a high-maintenance, complex procedure. Use our patented, innovative rainwater harvesting technology to collect and store clean rainwater that can be used in controlled amounts to help grow crops or to landscape lawns and plants.

                            <p>
                            A popular way to conserve rainwater in both rural and urban areas, rooftop rainwater harvesting, involves collecting rainwater on the roofs of buildings. A gutter system is installed on the rooftop to collect rainwater and direct it to a storage tank located either above or below the ground. The main components of the rooftop rainwater harvesting system include the following:
                            </p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Pipes and gutters for transporting rainwater from the roof to the storage tank.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Dual-intensity filters remove dirt and debris from collected rainwater before it enters the tank.</p>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Overflow pipe for carrying extra rainwater from the tank when it gets full.</p>

                            <p>Besides agriculture, rooftop rainwater harvesting can be useful for residential, commercial, government, educational and religious buildings.</p>

                            <p>
                            This method helps in collecting and storing rainwater flowing on the ground in underground tanks. It is easy to implement and highly advantageous, and offers great results when used in the right way. Ranches, farms, recreation areas, parks and municipalities can make the best use of rainwater collected from surface runoffs.

                            <p>Other ways to collect surface runoff rainwater for irrigation purposes include:</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Retention ponds that collect rainwater and improve its quality through natural procedures, like decomposition, soil filtration, sedimentation and solar disinfection. Such ponds generally feature mud bottoms lined with concrete for water collection and storage. The water thus saved can be used for watering livestock and for recharging groundwater.</p>

                                    <p>Underground storage tanks used for collecting rainwater, especially in areas where majority of the rainfall occurs in a single season. This involves connecting insulated underground tanks with low evaporation rates to electric pumps, ensuring a continuous supply of collected rainwater to different irrigation outlets.</p>
