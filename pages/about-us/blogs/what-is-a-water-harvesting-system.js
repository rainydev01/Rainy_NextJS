                            <p>
                            To produce water for irrigation right away or to store for later use in above-ground ponds or aquifers, water harvesting involves collecting runoff from rain storms from a catchment (the area from which water falls into bodies). The term "water harvesting" refers to the practice of collecting water from rainwater.

                            Do you want to know <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/">what is rainwater harvesting</a>? By using catchment areas like roofs, rocky surfaces, compounds, hill slopes, or intentionally restored impermeable or semi-pervious surfaces, rainwater can be collected and stored for later use. This is done with the help of artificially constructed systems. Rainwater collected through harvesting systems can be treated, stored, and used for many uses.

                            <h3>Direct use storage</h3>
                            <p>
                            Rainwater collected on a roof can be collected and stored using this method. The catchment's availability, rainfall, and water use must all be factored into the tank's design. Filtration systems, first flush devices, and mesh filters should be installed at the mouth of each drainpipe before they are connected to the storage tank. Every tank needs an overflow system when the water level is too high.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            More water may be redirected to the recharging system. Water from tanks can be used for non-essential tasks like washing clothes and watering plants. This system of collecting rainwater is the most cost-effective option.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The fundamental advantage of <strong>rain water harvesting model</strong> is the reduction of energy expenses connected with water distribution and transportation, in addition to the conservation of water from traditional sources. Groundwater can be conserved if pulled to meet demand even when it rains.

                            Precipitation can be used to restock groundwater aquifers by constructing various structures that allow water to seep into the ground rather than run off. The following are common methods of recharging:

                            The roof's water is drained and channelled into a filter or settling tank. After settling, the water is filtered and sent to bore wells, which pump it deep below to refill aquifers. Abandoned bore wells can also be refilled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Optimal settlement tank/filtration tank size can be derived from catchment area, rainfall quantity, and recharge rate. Floating trash and silt should be prevented from entering the charging facility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The first few raindrops should be wiped using a rain separator to avoid contamination.

                            <h3>Recharge pits</h3>
                            <p>
                            Recharge pits are small, regularly spaced pits with a weep hole enclosed by a masonry wall made of bricks or stones. Covering the top of the pit with a perforated covering is possible. The bottom of the pit should be lined with filter media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The amount of water collected in a pit depends on several factors, including its catchment area, the rainfall intensity, and the rate at which the soil recharges. The previous stratum's depth determines the pit's breadth and depth, which are typically 1–2 metres wide and 2–3 metres deep, respectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            These recharging wells are ideal for use with small homes and shallow aquifers.

                            Soakaway or recharge shafts are used in alluvial or impermeable soil. These 30 cm holes might reach 15 m deep, depending on the strata below. The bore must be lined with slotted or perforated PVC/MS tubing to prevent vertical sidewall collapse.

                            <p>
                            A suitable sump collects runoff at the top of the soakaway before it filters through. Sump should contain filter media.
