                            <h1>Water Should be the Next Important Environmental Target for India</h1>
                            <p>
                            Environmental protection, climate change control, reducing emissions and carbon footprint, etc., continue to be the top concerns around the world. However, water is another vital aspect we should not ignore. Various factors contribute to the water bodies drying out and disappearing from the earth's surface. Groundwater levels are lowering while sea and ocean waters are being polluted by chemicals and oil spills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            According to UN World Water Development Report, the demand for freshwater will increase supply by 2030. Many cities are already becoming water-insecure around the world. In such instances, developing countries like India need to up their game to focus on water conservation and groundwater protection while providing tap water to households across the land.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The Union government is running various programs and schemes to create awareness and conserve water for the future.

                            <h2>Catch the Rain</h2>
                            <p>
                            The National Water Mission, belonging to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, has launched a few projects to promote awareness about water conservation. For example, the Jal Shakti Abhiyan - Catch The Rain initiative urges households to develop appropriate rainwater harvesting structures (RWHS ) based on the climatic conditions in each state. The government has asked states to open rain Centers in each district to guide citizens in building RWHS for each property. This year’s event was launched by the Hon. President Droupadi Murmu.

                            <h3>Namami Ganga</h3>
                            <p>
                            Namami Ganga is a flagship program initiated by the Indian government in 2014 to control water pollution, promote conservation, and rejuvenate River Ganga. The program has been divided into three-level activities with a long-term plan – Entry level activities for immediate results, medium-level activities to be implemented in a 5-year time frame, and long-term activities with a 10-year target.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Atal Bhujal Yogana</h3>
                            <p>
                            Atal Bhujal Yogana is a union government program to facilitate sustainable groundwater management in the water-insecure or water-stressed regions in seven states (Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh). The scheme aims to improve sustainability while increasing farmers’ income and bringing behavioral changes to optimally use groundwater.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Border River Management</h3>
                            <p>
                            The River Management Activities And Works Related To Border Area focuses on the three major rivers – Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Indus, India shares with neighboring countries like Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The rivers occupy 42% of Indian geographical space and contribute to 60% of the total water consumption in the country. The scheme deals with various activities, such as hydrological observations, flood forecasting, anti-sea erosion activities in states and UTs bordering the seas, investigation of WR projects in neighboring countries, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Other programs like flood management, river basin management, national hydrology project, etc., have been launched over the years. However, there's no denying the depleting groundwater levels and suffering in drought areas in the country.

                            <h4>Water Demand vs. Supply and Annual Rainfall</h4>
                            <p>
                            Statistics show that India has access to only 4% of the world’s freshwater resources while having a population of 18%. The country’s national water level is 1500 m3 per year, which is less than the global threshold of 1700 m3 per year. This automatically puts India on the list of water-stressed countries. Furthermore, India depends on monsoons to fill the rivers, lakes, dams, and other irrigation and hydro projects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In such instances, even rainfall or drought can easily cause water scarcity in certain regions. This will directly impact agriculture and farming, resulting in lesser yield. In turn, this will affect the prices and cause inflation. With climate change affecting the natural monsoon cycle and annual rainfall, the country needs to develop more effective strategies for conserving existing water sources to support the ecosystem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Floods should be considered as they result in loss of life, property, and infrastructure. They also result in freshwater scarcity, making it difficult to find drinking water in flooded regions. Excess water and lack of water result in losses for the country. However, these are natural disasters and cannot be averted. Nevertheless, drought and flood management strategies need to be robust and proactive instead of reactive.
                            </p>


                            <h4>Micro Level Water Consumption and Metrics</h4>
                            <p>Setting measurable goals for water management in each city/ town/ village, district, state, region, etc., will help the authorities plan accordingly. Area-wise targets are easier to manage and achieve than national targets since we have a decentralized administrative system. This also brings more flexibility and scalability as successful water conservation projects from one city can be adopted in another city after adjusting the targets based on the demographics.</p>
                            <p>Another way to optimize water usage is to charge everyone, irrespective of the sector, based on their water consumption. This includes usage, wastage, and discharge into water bodies. Rainwater harvesting should be mandatory, along with clearly defined limits for groundwater usage, especially by commercial establishments. The agriculture, industrial, and corporate sectors should disclose their consumption percentages for effectively regulating and optimizing water usage. Since agriculture sector is among the top water-consumers in India, it’s important to offer alternative options for farmers to grow crops using lesser water.</p>


                            <h5>To Sum Up</h5>
                            <p>As citizens of the country, we also share the responsibility of conserving water for future generations, don’t we?
