                <h1>Types of rainwater harvesting filters</h1>
                <p>
                  The lack of freshwater resources makes it tough to meet the
                  standard water demand. Collection of rainwater from rooftops,
                  runoff, roads, open ground, etc; for utilization is known to
                  be rainwater harvesting. Rainwater can be stored or can be
                  used to recharge the groundwater table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Groundwater is the primary source of fresh water, and demand
                  for water is increasing in the domestic, agricultural, and
                  industrial sectors. Despite the advanced technologies or
                  devices being introduced to reduce water wastage, the world is
                  leading to an increase in water demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rainwater harvesting is a simple plan of action designed for
                  meeting long-term water demand for future use. The series of
                  actions involves the help of artificially designed systems to
                  collect and store rainwater. Rainwater from any surface is
                  collected and sent for filtration, storage, and utilization
                  for various purposes and also can be directly used for
                  groundwater table recharge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With depleting groundwater levels and fluctuating climate
                  conditions, rainwater harvesting helps mitigate the worse
                  condition of rising water scarcity. Retaining rainwater for
                  future use also helps to directly recharge local aquifers,
                  ensures the availability of water in water-stressed areas, and
                  aids in the reduction of flooding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rainwater harvesting aids in meeting the world's
                  ever-increasing water demand. It helps improve the quantity
                  and quality of groundwater when used for direct recharge.

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/products/rainy-filters">
                    There are several types of filtration methods, including the
                    ones listed below.
                  </a>

                <h4>Mechanical Pre-tank Filters</h4>

                <p>
                  Most rainwater filter methods include mechanical pre-tank
                  filters. The pre-tank filters stop contaminants like dirt and
                  debris from entering the storage tank of the rainwater
                  harvesting system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pre-tank filters, in general, consist of a stainless-steel
                  structure protected by a plastic body, though some models are
                  entirely plastic. The structure is usually made of stainless
                  mesh or grill. The mesh quality is measured in microns.
                  Depending on the design, the lesser the micron rating the
                  finer the degree of filtration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two types of mesh: horizontal mesh and vertical
                  mesh. This horizontal mesh requires more often cleaning than
                  the vertical mesh. Some models have advanced features such as
                  built-in cleaning functions that use water jets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on the requirements of specific situations. Certain
                  advancements or additional filtration treatments are required.
                  For instance, some industrial systems need water that has been
                  microscopically filtered, and some procedures might need water
                  that has been sterilised.

              </div>

              <div className="blog-info">
                <h4>Microscopic Filtration</h4>
                <p>
                  We can successfully achieve first-rate filtration using
                  microscopic filtration and specific filters. These filters now
                  come in the form of a sealed structure containing a cartridge
                  or bag that traps fine particles and provides pristine water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These types of filters require pressure for its proper
                  operation. Pumping requires pressure, or water is forced
                  through. These filters are commonly found in pumper water
                  supplies. They are typically expensive and used in large-scale
                  systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The advanced version of filters includes stainless steel
                  elements with a backwash function to facilitate cleaning.
                  Cleaning can also be done manually or with an automatic timer
                  control, which is effective and requires little maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another technology is membrane technology, which uses high
                  pressure to force water through a layer of material with
                  microscopic holes that trap particles. Membrane technologies
                  of this type are typically used in large-scale commercial
                  projects.

                <h4>Disinfection</h4>
                <p>
                  Mechanical filters give intended results in removing dirt and
                  debris from the water, which is not suitable to remove
                  bacteria in water. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  When rainwater is going to be used for purposes such as
                  drinking, showering, personal uses, etc. The process of
                  cleaning water, particularly with a chemical, to destroy
                  bacterial content is then critical.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Disinfection is further done by several methods such as using
                  chemical dosing, Reverse Osmosis (RO), or Ultra-Violet light
                  (UV). The most common method is UV disinfection, when properly
                  maintained; the UV method is a reliable and safe method. This
                  method sterilizes water by exposing it to Ultraviolet light at
                  a specific intensity and wavelength while it passes through a
                  glass tube. Water microorganisms are destroyed, and the water
                  is sterilized instantly. The annual replacement of UV lamps
                  makes maintenance simple.

              <div className="blog-info">
                <h4>Carbon Filters</h4>
                <p>
                  If rainwater is to be used for drinking, additional treatment
                  such as carbon filtration is required Rainwater collected in a
                  carbon filter passes through carbon, where water odour and
                  taste are being improved. The carbon filter also helps to
                  reduce discoloration in water. This is a common technique used
                  in households to filter water in jugs and under-sink units.
                  Carbon is also effective at removing chlorine and other
                  volatile organic substances (VOCs). A Granular Activated
                  Carbon module can be added to any rainwater system, or used as
                  a stand-alone unit.

                <h4>Sand and gravel</h4>
                <p>
                  Sand and gravel-type of filters are made using bricks, which
                  are filled using three layers of substances such as pebbles,
                  gravel, and sand. These three layers of the bed are separated
                  using mesh wire. This type of filter is very common. Water
                  flows through gravity here, removing different size particles
                  as it passes through each layer of pebbles, gravel, and sand.

              <div className="blog-info">
                <h4>Charcoal filters</h4>
                <p>
                  Charcoal filters are made of three layers, a gravel layer, a
                  sand layer, and then the final charcoal layer. Wire mesh is
                  also used to separate the three layers in this filter. The
                  purpose of the charcoal in this filter is to absorb the foul
                  odour present in the water.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="blog-info">
                <h4>PVC- Pipe filter</h4>
                <p>
                  These filters are made of PVC pipes. Which has a diameter of
                  6-8 inches and a length of 1-1.2 meters. There are three
                  layers, and the pipe is divided with wire mesh, into three
                  layers. Layer 1 contains gravel; Layer 2 contains charcoal and
                  Layer 3 contains sand. The endpoint of the filters is designed
                  in such a way that it matches the size of the outlet and
                  inlet. These filters can be installed both vertically and
                  horizontally.

                  The sponge filter is structured using a PVC drum. This
                  includes a spongy layer in the middle of the drum. This filter
                  is suitable for residential purposes. It is also an economic

                <h4>
                  Potable rainwater catchment system- rooftop water landing
                </h4>
                <p>
                  <h5>Level 1: Gutter Guards:</h5> Removes large debris and dirt
                  that are collected from your roof. To prevent clogging, leaf
                  decay, and built of bacteria, it is essential to screen the
                  leaf substances on a regular basis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>Level 2: First Flush Diverter:</h5>
                  FFD's first flush diverter comes between the gutter guard and
                  tank, which routes the first flow of water from the roof away
                  from a storage tank. Water from the first rain may contain
                  small particles such as dust, insect bodies, pollen, animal
                  faeces, pesticides, and other contaminants. Water from the
                  first flow can be routed to a garden or plantations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>Level 3: Overflow Skimmer:</h5>
                  The overflow skimmer is the first point at which rainwater
                  enters the tank, which benefits the catchment system. Overflow
                  skimmer removes the finest surface contaminants from the tank
                  and simultaneously overflow siphons keep the tank from
                  overflowing. This layer will give you a clean water zone and
                  intake for the next layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>Level 4: Floating Extractor:</h5>
                  The floating extractor is designed to extract water from the
                  cleanest zone of rainwater. This zone in the storage tank is
                  about 4 inches below the top of the water. This is preferable
                  to drawing water from the tank's bottom, where heavy sediment
                  settles, and it also avoids small skimming particles from the
                  top.
                </p>

                  <h5>Level 5: Spin down Filter:</h5>
                  The Spin down Filter uses the quantity of motion, mass, and
                  velocity of the water to throw particles out of the stream,
                  which settles in the lowest area of the filter. The spin-down
                  gets effortlessly rinsed through the bottom valve, which can
                  be back-flushed, and used over and over again. It does not
                  require extensive maintenance or replacement filters,
                  extending the life of subsequent canister filters.

                  <h5>Level 6: Filter Canister:</h5>
                  Filter Canister is 5, 10, and 20 microns. This assists the
                  next layer in the structure and the ceramic filter in
                  remaining clean. The filter size and input quality must be
                  changed on a regular basis, depending on the maintenance to be
                  performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>Level 7: Ceramic Filter:</h5>
                  The ceramic filter puts a considerably intense clean finish on
                  the water setup. Before entering, it should be filtered to 5
                  microns, which means less cleaning and fewer chances of
                  breaking the ceramic candles.

                <h3>Rainy Self-cleaning Roof Top Filter System</h3>
                <p>
                  The operation of self-cleaning filters is intended for one or
                  more downspout outlets. The design incorporates a hollow pipe
                  that leads into the filter inlet. This filter is designed to
                  accept both high and low-intensity loads that separate dirt
                  and debris that enter the filter with the rainwater via the
                  hollow pipe. Along with the self-cleaning mechanism, it
                  operates on the cohesion and centrifugal force principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because it is open-ended, it allows for free flow. The
                  vertically placed steel mesh prevents dirt, debris, and leaves
                  from accumulating in the filter. The filter includes a
                  self-cleaning mechanism. The open end leaning toward the drain
                  prevents solid substances from accumulating inside the
                  vertical filter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The intensity of rainfall has a direct relationship with
                  stability and filter function efficiency. The filter's
                  efficiency increases as the intensity and volume of rainfall
                  increase. At any given time, the minimum efficiency of the
                  filter ranges from 90 to 98% from outlets that can use it
                  effectively as needed. It is built with a hollow pipe that
                  leads into the Rooftop Filter's filter inlet.
                </p>
                <p>
                   This filter has the following features: compact size, wall
                  mounting, SS 304 filter element, user-friendly, 250-micron
                  dual intensity, auto flush out, high efficiency and works even
                  on low intensity of rain.

                  ' FL' V'-Wire injection well technology, developed in 2002,
                  was significantly improved in 2007 is used for groundwater
                  recharging . Here, gravitational energy is used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A silt trap unit, a recharge well with 20% filtration media of
                  crushed stone, gravels, coarse sand, activated carbon, and
                  charcoal; and the rest for water storage and a recharging bore
                  at the bottom of the recharge well comprise the entire
                  structure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Rainwater reaches the silt trap, which prevents silt from
                  entering the chamber. Overflow of water runs through a
                  horizontally connected pipe into the injection well fitted
                  with the FL ‘V’-Wire filter unit. Water travels through a
                  multilayer of filtration media placed at the top of the
                  Injection Well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the storage well, a water column is formed beneath the
                  filter media. The percolator pipe is installed at higher
                  depths of 30 to 60 metres below ground level by boring through
                  permeable strata and attaching it to the non-clogging FL
                  V-wire screen. Water is filtered as it travels through the
                  permeable layer. Water travels through the permeable layer due
                  to gravity and reaches the dry joints, cracks, and weathered
                  zone, where it recharges the aquifer that holds the
                  groundwater.

                  {" "}
                   Rainwater storage and treatment methodology contribute to
                  several problems of the global water crisis. Reduces over
                  usage of groundwater and reduces carbon footprint by
                  minimizing the pumping capacity. It is a systematized means of
                  water management, an economically efficient method.
