                <p>
                With the world facing water insufficiency and reports suggesting an increase in waterstressed areas by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-019-0039-9#:~:text=If%20monthly%2C%20rather%20than%20annual,to%205.7%20billion%20by%202050.">2050</a>, rainwater harvesting has become the need of the hour. As per the India Meteorological Department, Indian receives an average yearly rainfall of <a href="https://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest/contents/rainfallinformation.php">1,180 mm</a> but only <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/multiple-hurdles-in-rain-water-harvesting-india-inc/articleshow/70152000.cms">8%</a> of rainwater is harvested in the country. Rainwater harvesting, the most sustainable method of accessing fresh water, can offer up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/rainwater-harvesting">70%</a> of the water requirements of a household while also reducing flooding and water pollution. The process involves collecting and storing rainwater for varied uses, such as washing, drinking and irrigation. With proper installation and planning, different rainwater harvesting systems can be valuable and effective solutions to droughts and water scarcity. These systems can also help you save big on energy while reducing your dependence on municipal water supplies. Letâ€™s further explore different methods to harvest rainwater below:
                </p>
                
                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img2.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                The most common and easiest way to harvest rainwater, the method involves collecting rainwater in containers and storage tanks on rooftops of buildings channeled through downspouts and gutters. With minimal infrastructure requirement, this rainwater harvesting technique can be employed in both rural and urban areas. <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/products/rainy-filters">Rooftop rainwater harvesting systems</a> do not require extensive maintenance, apart from the standard guttercleaning upkeep. However, if there's a rain barrel with removable lid at the bottom of the spout, simply ensure the lid is attached tightly to prevent animals from climbing within and drowning.
                </p>

                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Surface Runoff Harvesting</h2>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img3.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                This technique collects water from huge open surfaces, such as pavements, open fields and roads in a more complex series of aquifers. The process is specifically useful in regions where rooftop harvesting is not the ideal option to collect rainwater for household usage, like showers, sinks, toilets and washing machines. Harvested water for such requirements will need a basic filter that should be changed and monitored regularly. Water is stored in a bacteria-resistant cistern, either buried or above ground, and requires a pump to move the water wherever it needs to go. You also need to ensure the water does not come into contact with heavy metals; preservative-treated timber or lead.
                </p>

                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Potable Water Systems</h2>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img4.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                One of the major problems of rainwater harvesting is creating drinkable, or potable water. So, companies have come up with potable water systems or safe collection areas, including filtration, pumping and additional treatment or filtering along with the need for piping. You can get all this and more at Rainy that offers affordable filters requiring minimum maintenance. However, it is important to check the filters from time to tome as overlooked filter replacements could compromise water quality, leading to illness and even death. This is one of the best rainwater harvesting investments that can make your building or home self-sufficient if your area receives adequate rainfall annually. This also means you do not remain hooked up to the city water supply which could further help you save good money.
                </p>

                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Percolation Pits</h2>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img5.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                Also known as soak aways, percolation pits are basically excavated quarries filled with several layers of sand and gravel. Rainwater is directed into these pits from where it slowly percolates into the ground and recharges the groundwater table. This method of rainwater harvesting is most effective in regions with porous soil.
                </p>

                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Check Dams</h2>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img6.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                These are small, temporary rainwater retaining structures built across gullies and streams to impede water flow. The water thus impeded percolates into the ground and recharges the groundwater levels.
                </p>

                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>In-Ground Storage Systems</h2>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img7.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                Made of plastic, concrete or other suitable materials, the in-ground or underground cisterns collect and store rainwater while minimizing space requirements and maintaining a neat and clean appearance.
                </p>

                <h2 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Contour Bunds</h2>
                <p>
                These are earthen embankments built along the contour lines of sloping land to serve as barriers that slow down the flow of rainwater and facilitate its absorption into the soil. This process of harvesting rainwater is specifically useful in sloping or hilly terrains.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Dry and Wet Systems</h3>
                <p>
                Inexpensive and easy to implement, the wet and dry systems for rainwater harvesting involve using collection pipes to empty rainwater directly into the top of a tank. This collection pipe dries after each rain event and is one of the best ways to store huge quantities of rainwater. The wet system of rainwater harvesting involves setting up a collection of pipes underground to connect several downspouts from varied gutters. Rainwater fills the underground piping system and water rises in the vertical pipes until it spills into the tank. In this system, the underground collection piping and the downspouts must feature water-tight connections while the tank elevation should be below the lowest gutter on the building.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Rain Gardens</h3>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img8.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                These are shallow depths featuring native plants and vegetation, specifically designed to collect and retain rainwater, letting it infiltrate the soil naturally. These small sunken garden landscapes use local soil, mulch and native plants to remove water pollutants, allowing it to move into the ground and recharge the ground water.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Storm Water Harvesting</h3>
                <p>
                This rainwater harvesting technique involves collecting rainwater from urban drainage systems, canals and storm water drains and diverting it into treatment facilities or storage tanks for later use.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Rain Barrels</h3>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img9.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                Installing a rain barrel is one of the easiest ways to store rainwater. You can easily make one with an empty drum or trash can and connect it to a pipe to transfer rainwater from the rooftop into it. Ensure the barrel does not become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and insects by covering it with tight-fitting lid and screen the ends of the downspouts leading into the barrel. These systems are highly beneficial because you can implement them easily without occupying lots of space in your home.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Rain Chain</h3>
                <div className="blogImg hero-image enthroimg">
                  <img src="../../../static/images/blogs/saving-rain-water-with-techniques-img10.jpg"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                Rain chains are environment-friendly, fashionable and fun accessories to avoid runoff by moving rainwater from collected pipes downwards into storage containers or drains. Generally made using spoons, vintage materials, small mugs and buckets and holders, rain chains are a more decorative way to harvest rainwater.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Reservoir for Rain</h3>                
                <p>
                The rooftop surface on which rainwater falls can be slanting or flat. This is connected to a pipe which is further connected to a storage container. The water thus stored can be used for watering gardens and washing cars. A win-win solution for the environment and economy, rainwater reservoir helps to save energy, further helping you save money.
                </p>

                <h3 style={{ margin: "20px 20px 20px 0px;" }}>Conclusion</h3>                
                <p>
