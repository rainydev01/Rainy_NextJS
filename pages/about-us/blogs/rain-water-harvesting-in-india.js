                <h1>Rainwater Harvesting in india</h1>
                <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                <p>
                  In ancient India, survival was the skeleton key where
                  civilizations, settlements, and empires rose and then fell.
                  Water, food, and shelter were a continuous struggle in dry
                  climates where water was scarce. The rainwater harvesting
                  system in India roots back to its origin of more than 4,000
                  years when the ancient administrative system purposed
                  rainwater for fundamental needs. However, the storage area is
                  unlike contemporary measures. The collected rainwater is
                  allowed to grow in rivers, lakes, dams, rooftop storage,
                  moats, and natural depressions. However, regional disputes
                  that led to water wars were common during those ages. India
                  has learned long back that surface water isn’t the only source
                  to serve the people’s water needs. Although India is the
                  country with the 9th largest fresh water reserve, 1,608
                  billion cubic meters a year, today it has moved its concern
                  from the surface to the ground. This is the area where India’s
                  freshwater is under the greatest stress, rain water harvesting
                  comes as a rescuing hand as well as an answerable alternative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The straightforward procedure of collecting and holding
                  rainwater in a storage container for later use is known as
                  "rainwater harvesting." Rain water can be collected from
                  roofs, lawns, sidetrack canals, and culverts alongside roads,
                  bridges, parks, and open land to be collected in storage tanks
                  (for immediate use) or in underground aquifers – natural or
                  man-made for groundwater recharge.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                  The three major techniques of rainwater harvesting are as
                  follows:
                </p>
                <li>
                  Surface run-off harvesting: Water flows through a channelized
                  way and can be used for future use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Groundwater recharge: A hydrologic process where water moves
                  underground from surface to ground water.
                </li>
                <li>Sedimentary Tanks for Domestic or Industrial Use</li>
                <h4 style={{ margin: "20px" }}>Water Scarcity in India:</h4>
                <p>
                  Water is becoming a precious commodity like blue diamonds in
                  India. India has 18 percent of the world’s population but only
                  4 percent of its water resources, making it among the most
                  water-stressed countries in the world. Indians are already
                  experiencing high to extreme water stress, according to the
                  Indian government’s NITI Aayog report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Below are the furnished numbers from the World Bank based on
                  its research:
                </p>
                <li>163 million in India lack access to safe drinking water</li>
                <li>210 million in India lack access to improved sanitation</li>
                <li>21% of communicable diseases are due to unsafe water</li>
                <li>
                  Each day, 500 underage children below 5 years in India die
                  from diarrhea
                </li>
                <p>
                  The rapid growth in India's urban areas has expanded the
                  government solutions, which have been compromised by
                  over-privatization. Water-borne infections, which account for
                  about 21% of cases, were caused by the contamination of both
                  biological and chemical pollutants found in water for
                  consumption & other domestic uses. Furthermore, traditional
                  sanitation is only available to 33% of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that large rural populations in India have begun to
                  move closer to urban expansion, market prices for goods are
                  rising, and people's lifestyles are changing supports the
                  claim that there is not enough labor to drill wells to reach
                  groundwater supplies in rural areas. As a result, the lack of
                  water in the country serves as a trap for rural residents to
                  obtain food and other necessities of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to recent World Bank estimates, by 2030, there will
                  be a 40% increase in India's water demand beyond what can be
                  supplied at the current rate. The country's economic and
                  social stability, as well as its security, are seriously at
                  stake due to water scarcity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  India's primary source of income comes from goods that are
                  primarily produced in rural areas, but unpredictable rainfall,
                  sudden droughts, strong storms, insect invasions of Indian
                  farming lands and flooding during the monsoon season make it a
                  complex issue, as each state has different topography,
                  climate, habitats, and ecological requirements.
                </p>
                <h4>Water Table Situation and its Statistics in India</h4>
                <p>
                  India's urban population is expected to increase significantly
                  over the next three decades, which poses a serious challenge
                  because the country's water supplies are already insufficient
                  to meet demand.
                </p>
                <li>
                  By 2030, 40% of India's population, up from 34% in 2011, is
                  expected to reside in urban regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  31% of urban homes do not have access to public tap water or
                  piping for drinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In urban India, 67.3% of homes lack access to a piped sewage
                  discharge system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to the Centre of Science and Environment,
                  groundwater supplies 48% of India's urban water needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The average amount of water given by urban local authorities
                  in India is 69.25 liters per person per day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Water in cities must be accessible in quantities of 135 liters
                  per person per day.
                </li>

                  How to overcome the Water Scarcity in India
                </h4>
                <h5>Tree-based Farming:</h5>
                <p>
                  Trees require less water and can withstand water stress for a
                  longer period of time. The viability of growing different dry
                  land horticulture crops, rather than timber and fuel wood
                  species, allows farmers to make money each year without
                  cutting down trees. Additionally, over two lakh tribal
                  families nationwide have been successfully rehabilitated
                  thanks to Agri-Horti-forestry. The main difficulty is giving
                  participant families a means of subsistence throughout the
                  4-5-year gestation period before the fruit trees bear fruit.
                  Planning promoted food crops amongst fruit trees, making
                  optimum use of the water resources that are available, and
                  conserving soil water effectively could increase crop yields
                  while maintaining food security. Agro forestry is a practical
                  solution to both the problem of water scarcity and the
                  mitigation of global warming.
                </p>
                <h5>Development of wastelands: </h5>
                <p>
                  Since over 9 million acres of rich land are sitting fallow due
                  to high salt content, the reclamation of sodic fields is
                  another crucial program that must be pursued. Particularly in
                  Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, excessive soil
                  erosion is harming productive agricultural lands and flooding
                  rivers, creating ravine lands. By conserving soil and water,
                  it will be possible for small farmers to drill tube wells at a
                  reasonable cost and use shared water resources to cultivate a
                  variety of crops.
                </p>
                <h5>Development of livestock: </h5>
                <p>
                  Water is needed to feed 500 million heads of livestock and to
                  provide fodder for them, making animal husbandry a significant
                  field. Farmers release animals of lower quality onto the field
                  for free grazing. This has resulted in severe soil erosion and
                  the denudation of vegetation. By allowing farmers to use stall
                  feeding, they can shrink their herd size, increasing their
                  revenue while reducing the burden on natural resources,
                  especially water stress.
                </p>
                <h5>Water Resource Expansion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The solution is to utilize all available water resources and
                  make them accessible for sustainable use while increasing
                  water use efficiency. This can be accomplished by addressing
                  various issues and launching appropriate activities for the
                  creation of new water resources, the expansion of currently
                  available resources, the prevention of water pollution, and
                  the enhancement of water usage efficiency across all sectors.
                </p>
                <h5>
                  Increasing the amount of surface water that can be stored:
                </h5>
                <p>
                  By building small and medium-sized dams and rivers, as well as
                  agricultural ponds, percolation tanks, and water reservoirs,
                  more surface water may be stored while the recharging of the
                  groundwater is increased. A series of contour limits,
                  especially in undulating terrain, will improve the groundwater
                  table and promote the percolation of water. Creating a series
                  of tiny dams on rivulets and sealing gullies will both aid in
                  the storage of water in reservoirs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The mountainous state of Uttarakhand's villages suffers from a
                  lack of water supplies, as it is difficult to construct and
                  maintain the necessary infrastructure due to the region's
                  steep Himalayan topography. Many residents, especially women,
                  have to go more than 1.6 kilometers to get potable water for
                  domestic use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the mountain state frequently experiences flash floods,
                  earthquakes, and landslides, building infrastructure and
                  institutional capacity, and supporting local enterprises with
                  full participation of village communities will make them more
                  resilient to handle natural disasters.

                  On the contrary, Tamil Nadu, especially the southern
                  metropolis of Chennai, reeled under a fatal water crisis in
                  2019. Water was brought in by train from some 200 kilometers
                  away to save the city. The measure is to collect water by
                  putting local communities in charge of managing their own
                  water supply schemes.

                  The groundwater table rises with RWH, resulting in the revival
                  of abandoned tube wells.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rainwater collection improves groundwater quality and lowers
                  the cost of pumping tube wells. Due to ground-to-surface
                  pumping, a one-meter rise in water level typically saves
                  roughly 0.40 kW/h of electricity.

                  Rainwater harvesting enhances rainwater infiltration, which
                  has significantly decreased in metropolitan areas due to
                  concretization. By ensuring that rainwater soaks into the
                  ground quickly, it prevents water logging and flooding.
