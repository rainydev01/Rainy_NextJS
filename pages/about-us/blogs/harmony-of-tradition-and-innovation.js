                            <p>
                            Rainwater harvesting is a process of conserving rainwater which includes collecting, storing and conveying and purifying the rainwater which falls on the rooftops, parks, roads and open grounds. The harvested rainwater can be used for the various potable and non-potable purposes. One of the main importance of rainwater harvesting technique is it helps to conserve and replenish the water resources. By collecting the rainwater, we can reduce our dependency on the primary water resources such as rivers, lakes and aquifers. In the areas where there is a limited access for freshwater, rainwater harvesting system can be a savior, it allows the individuals, communities and industries to become less dependent on the freshwater resources, particularly during the droughts. Rainwater harvesting is crucial for the agricultural sector mainly in the regions of irrigation, the collected rainwater can be used for the irrigation of crops by reducing our dependency on the groundwater or other external water resources.

                                    Our ancestors were perfecting the art of water management, paar systems is a common water harvesting practice in the western Rajasthan region. It is a common place where the rainwater flows from the catchment area and percolates into the sandy soil. Talabs are the reservoirs. These are the human made structures in which the water can be used for the irrigation and for the drinking purposes. Saza Kuva is an open well with multiple owners, saza kuva is a most important source of irrigation in the eastern regions of Rajasthan. Johads are the small earthen check dams that captures and conserve rainwater which improves the percolation and groundwater recharge. Pat system is a unique system developed in Bhitada village, jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh. This system diverts the terrain water from the flowing streams and channels into irrigation channels called pats. These were some of the types of rainwater harvesting systems that were practiced earlier.

                                    Rainwater overhead tanks these are the simple tanks which can be placed over the building or on the terrace area, which collects all the water as it rains. Rooftop rainwater harvesting These are the simple structure where roof can be used as a catchment area eventually the collected rainwater can be used for the various purposes even for the groundwater recharging, Agricultural rainwater harvesting systems these systems are designed to meet the water demands of the farms and crops. Ground water dams this method of rainwater harvesting is mainly used in the places where the underground water levels are low. During the rainy season the water percolates from the surface and gradually reaches the underground reservoirs. <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com">Automatic rainwater harvesting systems</a> these systems will be integrated with the sensors and controllers to automate the collection and distribution of the rainwater.  These sensors can detect rainfall and also optimize usage of water and preventing the overflow or the wastage.
