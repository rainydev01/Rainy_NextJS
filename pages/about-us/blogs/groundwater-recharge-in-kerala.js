                            <h1>Different Methods Used for Groundwater Recharge in Kerala</h1>
                            <p>
                            Groundwater or water beneath the Earth’s surface in the fractures and pores of sediments and rocks sustains life on Earth. It is a major resource for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use. It also supports ecosystems by maintaining wetlands and stream flow. Nevertheless, over-extraction and increased demand for groundwater have led to declined water tables in several regions. Therefore, groundwater recharge in Kerala is necessary to resolve water scarcity problems and safeguard the ecosystem. Read on to explore how groundwater is recharged in Kerala, but before that, let’s understand the groundwater recharge procedure.

                            <h2>Groundwater Recharge Procedure</h2>
                            <p>
                            Groundwater recharge is the process used to infiltrate soil and refill groundwater aquifers with surface water or water from artificial sources and precipitation. This natural mechanism replenishes groundwater levels, thus sustaining spring wells and various other water sources. Now, let us have a look at the different ways of recharging groundwater in Kerala.

                            <h3>Spreading Basins</h3>
                            <p>
                            This method is perfect for groundwater recharge in Kerala, especially in areas featuring layers below the aquifer and land surface and where clear water is available in abundance. It involves excavating existing terrain and surface flooding water in basins. However, it is crucial to practice this method of groundwater recharge in areas with highly permeable soils and use different ways to maintain the layer of water over this soil.
                            </p>
                            <p>In case of direct water discharge, the amount of water entering the aquifer will depend on the potential for horizontal water movement, percolation rate and infiltration rate. Nevertheless, clogging may occur at the aquifer surface due to deposition of particles carried by water in solution or in suspension’ colloidal swelling, microbial activity, soil dispersion and algae growth.</p>

                            <h3>Injection or Recharge Wells</h3>
                            <p>
                            Advantageous in areas with scarce land or those where a thick impervious layer exists between the soil surface and aquifer, this method of <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/about-us/blogs/groundwater-recharge-in-tamil-nadu">groundwater recharge in Kerala</a> involves digging recharge or injection wells to recharge the deep, water-bearing strata directly. Groundwater is recharged using V-wire injection well technology, and V-wire screens are used for filtration. This modern method of groundwater recharge offers a high rate of recharge and uses gravitational force instead of energy, making it extremely durable.

                            <p>
                            There are rare conditions allowing surface flooding procedures of artificial groundwater recharge, especially in areas featuring low permeability between the water table and land surface. In such situations, artificial recharge mechanisms, like shafts and pits, can be effective. Though this method of groundwater recharge in Kerala offers a high recharge rate, it is crucial to maintain the bottom and sides of the pits that may have thin film of sediments deposited due to unfiltered water runoff. Shafts also offer a good rate of recharge regardless of their shape, which can be rectangular, square cross-section, or circular. However, recharge rates in both pits and shafts may decrease with time due to the plugging effect of microbial activity and the accumulation of fine-grained materials.

                            Ditches or long, narrow trenches with bottom widths less than depth are specifically designed to suit geological and topographic conditions at a certain site. A ditch layout may feature several trenches running down the topographic side, carrying away un-infiltrated water to avoid ponding and also to reduce the build-up of fine particles.

                            The most traditional way of groundwater recharge in Kerala, farm ponds, are small water storage systems that collect and store runoff water for irrigation and drinking purposes. There are two farm ponds: embankment ponds suitable for rugged and hilly terrains and excavated farm ponds suitable for flat topography. Choosing the location of a farm pond will depend on varied factors, like land topography, rainfall, texture, soil type, permeability, land-use pattern, and water holding capacity.
