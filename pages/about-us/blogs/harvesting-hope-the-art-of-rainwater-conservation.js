                            The world is facing a water crisis, with millions of people lacking access to clean and safe drinking water. It is a situation that impacts not only in the dry regions but also in the water abundant areas. This situation is caused due to the climate change, pollution and also over use of water resources. Rainwater harvesting emerges as ray of hope to overcome this challenge.

                            Rainwater conservation is not just about securing your water supply; its about protecting our environment. The runoff rainwater may contain pollutants from roads, rooftops and other surfaces will end up flowing into the rivers and lakes. The contaminated rainwater is harmful for both aquatic and human life. By harvesting rainwater, we can reduce the stress on these water bodies and allows the nature to clean itself.
