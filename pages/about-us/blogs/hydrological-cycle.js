                <h2>Hydrological cycle</h2>
                <p>
                  Water is one of the world’s most valuable resources that has
                  to be retained for an inclusive future. Water is absolutely
                  important to life on earth. Water contributes to the major
                  part of the earth and earth’s climatic balance.
                </p>
                <p>The three states of water are:</p>
                <p>Solid - Ice or snow, such as ice bergs and glaciers</p>
                <p>Liquid - Water</p>
                <p>Gas - Water vapor or steam</p>
                <p>
                  The Hydrological cycle explains the multi-step journey of
                  water that transports from the surface of the earth, to the
                  atmosphere and falls again to the earth’s surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The movement of water to and fro of the earth’s surface drives
                  global weather pattern. There is an exchange of energy where
                  water releases energy to warm the environment to condense and
                  takes energy from the environment to evaporate, influencing
                  climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hydrological cycle commonly known as water cycle illustrates
                  the continuous movement of water on earth and above and below
                  the surface of the earth. Throughout the course, water changes
                  its state from one form to another by undergoing a variety of
                  process such as:
                </p>

                  <li>1. Evaporation</li>

                  <li>3. Evapotranspiration</li>

                    <h3>1. Evaporation</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Water is found in various forms on the earth’s surface such
                    as oceans, lakes, swamps, and soil, as well as in all living
                    creatures and plants. Sun is the source of energy which
                    drives the process of evaporation. Evaporation happens when
                    heat is applied from sun the water molecules change its
                    state of energy, it loses density and rise in the air in
                    vapor form called evaporation. And thus, forming clouds.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evaporation takes place when water reaches the boiling
                    point. In areas were the humidity and air pressure are less,
                    because the lower pressure cannot hold water molecules
                    together, less heat energy is required for evaporation to
                    occur.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <h3>2. Sublimation</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    There falls a doubt, if ice and snow could evaporate? Yes,
                    Ice and snow can turn into water vapor directly without
                    changing into liquid state. This happens when there is a low
                    temperature, low air pressure, strong sunlight, strong wind,
                    low humidity and dry winds. Less energy is needed to
                    sublimate the ice into water vapor. Generally, this happens
                    at the peak of the mountains such as Mount Everest. This is
                    called sublimation.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <h3>3. Evapotranspiration</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Water evaporates from leaves of the plants and trees is
                    called evapotranspiration. Hence the earth is covered by a
                    large area of vegetation. Due to this process a huge amount
                    of water is produced in the atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lakes, ocean, and streams contributes ninety percentage of
                    water vapor, the plant life contributes to the remaining ten
                    percentage.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <h3>4. Condensation</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    The water vapor in the atmosphere cools down considerably.
                    The water vapor comes in contact with the low temperature
                    that is cooler air found up in the sky forming tiny
                    droplets. Thus, forming clouds by the moving air currents
                    and winds.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <h3>5. Precipitation</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    The water vapor condenses on tiny particles of dust, which
                    rose while evaporation process. The water vapor attaches to
                    the surface of the dust particles forming tiny droplets. The
                    tiny droplets merge to produce a larger droplet in the
                    clouds. This falls from the clouds to the ground surface as
                    rainfall called precipitation.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <h3>5. Infiltration</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    The process of absorption of rain water into the soil to the
                    ground is known as infiltration. Soil is a porous material
                    that absorbs more water than rocks can hold. The rain water
                    seeps into the soil to nearby streams or seeps deeper to
                    ground water table forming aquifers.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <h3>6. Runoff</h3>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    While the snow melts or if rain does not reach aquifers, the
                    water follows gravity and falls down to steeps or mountains
                    and joins or forms rivers. This is called runoff . Water
                    comes to lakes and return to ocean.

                  <h3>Importance of Hydrological Cycle Processes</h3>
                  <p>
                    List down are few reasons why the water cycle is important:

                      <p>
                        • Hydrological cycle plays a role in maintaining the
                        balance of aquatic ecosystems. The water cycle is one of
                        the major biogeochemical cycles of the earth, to
                        maintain life on earth.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        • The water cycle plays a major role to ensure
                        availability of water to all the living organisms such
                        as humans, animals, plants and other living species.
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        • The hydrologic cycle is the natural process that plays
                        a important role in the continuous transformation of
                        water above and below and on the surface of the Earth.
                        Also recycles minerals, nutrients, pathogens, and
                        elements along with the water in the ecosystem.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        • Human life is totally dependent upon the fresh water.
                        Water makes 70 percent of all living organisms, and
                        humans rely on water. The water cycle is an extremely
                        essential process that enables the availability of water
                        for all living organisms and regulates global weather
                        patterns.{" "}

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        • A natural depot of freshwater sources for both humans
                        and other organisms are: Glaciers, ice, and snow. There
                        is a need for the aquatic life, to maintained pH levels
                        of salt water and saline ranges to sustain in the sea or
                        ocean. So, water has to be purified even for aquatic
                        ecosystem and for the benefit of human life, animal life
                        and plant life.

                      <p>
                        • According to researchers, only three percent of water
                        is freshwater accounts for all the water on Earth. On
                        the wholesome of these three percentages, the majority
                        two percentage of water is in the form of glaciers and
                        ice bergs or stored below ground. The remaining one
                        percent is to be found in rivers, wetlands and lakes or
                        in the form of water vapor, clouds and precipitation.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        • Just imagine if the water cycle doesn’t take place,
                        i.e. recycling of water does not happen to distribute
                        freshwater all over the surface of the earth, we human
                        and other living species would run out of clean water,
                        which is essential to live.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        • Effects of hydrological cycle on climate. Eighty-six
                        percentage of the evaporation in the global level occurs
                        from the oceans. Sun is the major power source that
                        drives water cycle. Without the cooling effect

                        • Evaporation and infiltration help purification of
                        water by natural process, when evaporation takes place
                        the dust or the sediments are left behind. Whereas while
                        the water undergoes infiltration, when the water seeps
                        into the soil, soil is a porous material which can
                        naturally filter contaminants and pollutants from the
                        water.

                        • The water cycle process supports life and creates a
                        biological community of interacting organisms and their
                        physical environment around us. Some organisms are
                        sensitive to changes that take place in the water cycle.
                        An extended drought can end the existence of a
                        population of plants or a certain species may require a
                        point of saturated soil in order to avoid the removal of
                        moisture content for them.

                        • The water cycle operates and controls Biogeochemical
                        Cycle. The water cycle and rainfall pattern influences
                        Earth’s ecosystems. Rainfall and surface runoff plays
                        major role in the cycling of various elements.

                        • Surface runoff helps in the movement of elements from
                        terrestrial, land-based, to aquatic ecosystems. In
                        ecology and Earth science, a biogeochemical cycle is
                        cycling of substances is a pathway by which chemical
                        substance also moves through biosphere, lithosphere,
                        atmosphere, and hydrosphere of Earth. This includes
                        chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,
                        nitrogen, mercury, phosphorus, calcium, selenium, and

                        • Rainwater plays a key role in climatic changes.
                        Rainwater harvesting is a process done to collect
                        rainwater and store it for human use. Global problem
                        needs a speedy solution. One such methos is rain water
                        harvesting, which would be a great solution during water
                        scarcity.
