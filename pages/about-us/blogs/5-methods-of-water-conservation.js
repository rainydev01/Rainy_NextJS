                            <h1>5 Methods of Water Conservation: How Rainy Filters is Playing Its Part?</h1>
                            <p>
                            Do you know that 30% to 60% of domestic drinking water goes into watering gardens and yards, and a large portion is wasted due to evaporation, misdirected sprinklers and over-watering? With the global average water footprint being 3.8 tons per day, it is crucial to embrace water conservation solutions that can save 130-210 million gallons of water per day. Read on to know about 5 methods of water conservation used widely for the way they help save water without using much money and effort.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
                            
                            <p>It is the procedure of collecting and storing rainwater for future use. This all-encompassing term includes both harvesting rainwater and <a herf="https://www.rainyfilters.com/products/ground-water-recharge">artificial recharge of groundwater</a> by directing rainwater into the ground. This is specifically done either by spreading rainwater on a surface or by using recharge wells.</p>

                            <p>Conserve water in no time by using the easy to install and economically feasible rainwater harvesting systems at Rainy Filters, perfect for industrial and domestic use. Featuring large catchments to collect runoff into reservoirs and ponds, these systems offer chemical-free water for drinking, agriculture and other allied activities.</p>

                            <h2>Groundwater Recharge</h2>
                            <p>As has already been said, groundwater recharge involves harvesting rainwater to recharge different sources of ground water artificially. This can be done using varied structures, like recharge shafts and injection wells. Different spreading techniques, such as nala bunds, check dams, ditches, furrows and percolation tanks can also be used to recharge ground water.</p>

                            <p>At Rainy Filters, our ground water recharge system features the following components:</p>

                            <ul style={{ "marginTop": "50px", "listStyleType": "disc" }}>
                                <li>
                                    <p>A silt trap unit or 5 to 6 metres deep recharge well with 20% filtration media. It contains gravels, crushed stone, activated charcoal and carbon and coarse sand.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Recharging bore at the bottom of the recharge well.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Remaining unit used for water storage.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The process goes like this:</p>
                            <ul style={{ "marginTop": "50px", "listStyleType": "disc" }}>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Collected and purified rainwater goes through a water channel and reaches the silt trap letting silt settle down in the chamber.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Overflow water goes into the Injection Well fitted with an FL V-wire filter unit using a horizontally connected pipe.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Next, water passes through a multilayer of filtration media located on top of the Injection Well.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Then it collects below <a herf="https://www.rainyfilters.com">rain water harvesting filters</a> in a specifically designed storage well that creates a water column.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>And after passing through permeable strata, water reaches the weathered zone, dry joints and cracks to recharge the aquifer holding groundwater.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                            Upgrading operational infrastructure is one of the most practical ways to conserve water. Industries that use water for decontaminating, cleaning and sanitizing products and components can invest in high-quality filtration and spray nozzle systems. They can even upgrade their valves, pipes, tanks, nozzles and other water-related systems with energy-efficient alternatives.

                            Leaking pipes and dripping taps may be inconsequential, but they may lead to significant water wastage over time. Therefore, both residential homes and commercial units must schedule routine maintenance checks to pinpoint and address such water inefficiencies.

                            <p>
                            Water-efficient appliances, like washing machines with eco-friendly ratings and low-flow toilets, can reduce household water usage dramatically. On the other hand, industries can choose high-rated industrial-grade machinery and appliances specifically designed for optimal water efficiency.

                            <p>
                            Think of different ways to reuse and recycle water. For example, the grey water from sinks and showers can be repurposed and used to water plants and flush toilets instead of going down the drain uselessly. Conversely, large companies can use on-site water recycling systems to transform wastewater into a major resource.
