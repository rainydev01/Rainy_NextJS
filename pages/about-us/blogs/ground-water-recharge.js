              <h1>Groundwater Recharge</h1>
              <p>
                In recent years, there is a raised concern about meeting our own
                needs without compromising the ability of future generations to
                meet their own needs. There comes a demand for water consumption
                to fulfil increasing residential and irrigation demands.
                Nevertheless, with the help rainwater harvesting techniques
                there comes the chance to make it possible to maintain and
                increase the levels of depleting groundwater resources.
              </p>

                <h2>Ground water recharge methods</h2>
                <p>
                  Groundwater recharge is a process, where water seeps down from
                  the surface of the earth and gets collected in aquifers. So,
                  the process is also known as deep percolation or recharging
                  the ground water table.
                </p>
                <p>Groundwater recharge happens in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Direct Recharge</li>
                  <li>Indirect recharge</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Direct recharge: Water addedby directly in vertical
                  percolation to the groundwater reservoir in excess of soil
                  moisture and evapotranspiration deficits. Such as surface
                  spreading like flooding, basins or percolation tank, stream
                  augmentation, ditch and furrow system. In sub surface like
                  recharge well, recharge pit/shaft, dug well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indirect recharge: Results from percolation to the water table
                  following runoff and localization in joints, as ponding in low
                  lying areas and lakes, or through beds of surface water
                  courses. Such as induced recharge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natural recharge happens as rain falls on the land surface,
                  infiltrates into soils, and moves through pore spaces down to
                  the water table. Natural recharge also can take place as
                  surface-water leakage from rivers, streams, lakes, and
                  wetlands.
                  <ol>
                    <li>1. Through rain or snowmelt</li>
                    <li>2. Rivers and lakes</li>
                    <li>3. Depression focused recharge</li>
                  </ol>

                  Artificial recharge options such as recharge ponds and
                  injection wells, Recharge ponds allow water to slowly
                  infiltrate through the soil into the aquifer under the ground.
                  Injection wells use artificial pressure that is created from
                  the water column to push the water into the ground.

                    1. Through rain and snow melt:
                    <p>
                      Water from the melting of snow and rain can directly fill
                      the aquifer from the areas having high altitudes through

                  <li>

                    <p>
                      The amount of water the soil can hold after the excess
                      water from rainfall is drained out.If the water present on
                      the ground doesn’t exceed the field capacity of the area,
                      then a little amount of water infiltrates into the ground.

                      The surface infiltration system is a method of spreading

                      to seep into the ground. This technique is possible in
                      areas where the soil is permeable to allow water to pass
                      through it.

                      spreading the water over a larger area making it easier
                      for infiltration process using dams, L or T-shaped levees

                  is beyond the water percolating method or inject deep into the
                  earth. This undergoes a treatment process by changing its
                  composition while infiltrating down to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The water is being pre-treated before directed into the
                  ground. Considering surface runoff rainwater is taken for the
                  recharge process. After that the water undergoes
                  post-treatment via aquifer layers, and this process is also
                  known as Soil Aquifer Treatment(SAT).

                  An example for artificial Injection Well groundwater recharge
                  is ‘V’ wire technology method.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Groundwater rechargingmost effective in holding surface run
                  off water both from plain open loose area. This is done using
                  V-Wire Injection Well Technology. This is a modern technique
                  which uses V-Wire Screens for filtration. This system works on
                  gravitational force that does not require any energy, making
                  it durable with a long-life span.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The strategic points for drilling injection wells are
                  identified via geo-physical survey. Fracture zones, cracks and
                  joints present in the permeable zone have remarkable ability
                  to store water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are four stages of filtration through Silt Trap and
                  Injection well. The silt traps: most impuritiesget trapped in
                  the first stage itself. And the water flows through the
                  horizontally fixed V wire non clogging SS screen. Water then
                  passes through multi layered filtration media and gets stored
                  and creates a water column. Rainwater then flows through main
                  Injection well where and recharge groundwater table.

                <p>
                  This ‘v’ wire injection well technology can also be adopted
                  next to existing borewell to increase the yield redundancy.

                      recharge allows surface water sources to flow for extended
                      periods, and seasonal streams may acquire perennial flow
