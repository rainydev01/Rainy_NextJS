                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>
                            Water is the most important and valuable natural resource on earth. It sustains all life on earth. Water is essential for the survival of all living beings on Planet. We completely depend on water for a variety of functions, including agriculture, irrigation, drinking, cooking, bathing and other domestic needs. Water has recently been neglected, although its importance in our lives. Water shortage is increasing as a result of excessive consumption of water, global warming and climate change. The availability of safe drinking water is limited, so water conservation is essential. We'll discover more about techniques on <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/about-us/blogs/harnessing-the-power-of-rainwater-harvesting">how to save water</a>.

                            Conserving water in the home by replacing the old toilets with a water sense-labeled high efficiency toilet that can save up to four times the water every flush. To prevent wastage of water, water leaks must be checked and repaired on a regular basis. Taking short showers can save you up to 10 liters of water every minute.  Installing a high-efficiency showerhead can save up to three liters of water per minute. Wash only full loads in dishwashers. Scraping instead of pre-rinsing can conserve up to 70 liters of water.

                            <p>
                            More than half of the average household's water is used outdoors. By taking simple initiatives, we can reduce the amount of water used outdoors, such as inspecting your garden hose and irrigation system, and using a shut-off nozzle on the hose to avoid unwanted leaks. Watering outdoor plants in the morning or late in the evening will reduce water loss due to evaporation. Using brooms to remove dirt from outdoor living areas will be more efficient than hosing. Avoid trimming the lawn during the dry season; the longer the grass grows, the better it will shade the soil and retain moisture. Only water your lawn when absolutely essential; overwatering causes the formation of shallow root systems that can be easily damaged. Take your car for to the car wash rather than washing it at home because most of the commercial car washes recycle the water. Washing your pet outdoors in an area of your lawn that needs watering.

                            <p>
                            Rainwater harvesting system plays an important role in the process of saving water. Rainwater harvesting is a process of collecting, storing and using the rainwater for the various potable and non-potable purposes. By harvesting rainwater, we can minimize our overall dependency on the natural water resources. The harvested rainwater can be used for many outdoor purposes such as watering gardens, washing cars, washing pets and many more, even with the proper filtration it can be used even for the drinking, cooking etc. Rainwater harvesting can also reduce the instances like flooding and soil erosion, it reduces the overall flow of stormwater by reducing the urban flooding. It reduces the demand of groundwater, even by collecting and utilizing the harvested water can be used for the groundwater recharging can increase the groundwater level which improves the overall productivity of the natural aquifers.
