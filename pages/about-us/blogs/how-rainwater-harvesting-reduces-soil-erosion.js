                How Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) reduces soil erosion and
                flooding ?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The act of collecting rainwater runoff from a building or other
                impermeable surface so that it can be stored for use later is
                commonly known as Rain Water Harvesting (RWH).
              </p>
              <p>
                In many parts of the world, Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) is a
                common activity, and in the appropriate circumstances, it may
                offer a practical, affordable, and environmentally friendly
                source of water. In theory, Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) is a
                straightforward and inexpensive practice that offers numerous
                potential advantages while requiring little specialized
                knowledge or skill.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to sudden and unexpected rains, soil erosion becomes a fatal
                environmental threat around the world and a real factor in the
                degradation of soil fertility. Techniques like Rain Water
                Harvesting (RWH) increase agricultural output and soil water
                storage, which could lead to more efficient use of the available
                land.

                Research forecasts food and nutritional security as the most
                concerning topic of the century, and feeding an additional 3
                billion people by 2050 in our country will be a struggle for all
                of us. About 95% of the population expansion will take place in
                emerging or poor countries, where agriculture makes up a
                significant amount of the per capita GDP. The bulk, or two
                thirds, of the world's poorest people are among the 1.1 billion
                farmers who depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP,
                2014), by 2050, more than two billion people are expected to
                live under high water stress conditions, which will be a
                limiting factor for growth in many nations around the world. The
                main focus should be on improving rain-fed/dry land soil
                fertility in areas confronting climatic changes, in terms of
                rain and frequent floods, because water is the actual game
                changer, as excessive water loss limits water availability and
                results in the loss of important nutrients from the soil.
              </p>
              <h4>Soil Erosion:</h4>
              <p>
                To avoid soil erosion and save water, if the majority of the
                rain falls in one or two spells in arid regions, the majority of
                the rain is never saved for later use and is instead wasted. In
                addition to having little rain, dry areas also experience
                "natural leakage," in which 90% of the rain is lost either
                directly or indirectly and is not available for domestic or
                agricultural use. Many countries are on the verge of a historic
                water shortage. Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) entails using
                techniques that enhance the quantity of water stored in the soil
                profile by capturing or retaining the rain where it falls. It
                also involves capturing small amounts of precipitation as
                surface runoff.
              </p>

              </div>
              <p>
                Water harvesting keeps the soil wet and significantly lowers
                runoff. This boosts productivity and guarantees home,
                industrial, and agricultural needs. RWH increases the moisture
                content of the earth's surface. There has been an increased
                focus on and deployment of techniques that improve infiltration
                and water storage in the soil layers underneath because of the
                unexpected and very quick loss of water gathered through RWH due
                to evapo-transpiration. It is important to highlight that RWH
                can also be used for degraded land restoration and moisture
                retention. Water can be kept in the subsurface as soil moisture
                or groundwater as well as in artificial structures, surface
                reservoirs (ponds, dugouts, artificial reservoirs, large pits
                within or beside the compound opposite buildings), and
                artificial constructions.
              </p>
              <p>
                RWH is the most effective strategy for increasing soil moisture
                in water-shortage zones since soil moisture conservation
                (recharging shallow aquifers) is the key to good productivity.
                Standardizing Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) practices is urgently
                needed to boost water production for rain-fed, self-sufficient
                household water demands as well as agricultural for higher yield
                and productivity.

                Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the intentional collection of
                rainwater from a surface known as a catchment and its storage in
                built structures or within the soil profile, allowing rain to be
                caught and used "near" to where it first enters the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution to major problems such as poor productivity, soil
                erosion, soil degradation, high climate variability, and food
                insecurity is RWH. Although RWH has been used in many arid and
                semi-arid regions, it is crucial to maintain and recharge
                groundwater. The main users of RWH techniques are eco-conscious
                home dwellers, farmers, and other people who value the
                environment, especially in low moisture situations. Experiences
                with RWH reveal improved soil moisture, recharged groundwater,
                reduced runoff, and increased crop output, ensuring security in
                terms of nutrition and livelihood.

              <h5>If Rainwater passes through the soil</h5>
              <p>
                The land can mostly absorb the rain that falls while it is in
                its natural state. Water that is absorbed by the soil refills
                groundwater reserves. The soil does not absorb rainwater that
                falls on parking lots, buildings, driveways, and roads. Instead,
                it drains into streams, rivers, and storm drains.
              </p>
              <h5>When rainwater seeps into the ground</h5>
              <p>
                It naturally infiltrates through exposed soil surfaces and
                cracks into the shallow and deep aquifer. But when there is no
                vegetation covering the soil, rainwater washes it away,
                frequently carrying with it the highest levels of biological
                activity and organic soil materials.
              </p>
              <h5>If rain water infiltrates the soil:</h5>
              <p>
                Infiltration of water into soil is referred to as infiltration
                or percolation, permeability, or hydraulic conductivity refers
                to the downward movement of water inside the soil.
              </p>
              <h5>Time to harvest rainwater:</h5>

                <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/">
                  Rain Water Harvesting
                </a>{" "}
                (RWH) is the practise of collecting and storing rainwater as
                opposed to letting it flow off. Rainwater is gathered from a
                surface that resembles a roof and directed to a container with
                percolation, such as a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or
                borehole), aquifer, or reservoir where it seeps down and
                replenishes the ground water table.
              </p>
              <h5>Role of collecting water collecting in home needs:</h5>
              <p>
                The act of collecting runoff for productive uses is the primary
                purpose of water harvesting. Runoff is collected and used, as
                opposed to being let to erode land. Water harvesting is a
                directly beneficial method of soil and water conservation in the
                semi-arid drought-prone areas where it is already practised.
              </p>
              <h5>Benefits of collecting rainwater:</h5>
              <p>
                Benefits of Rainwater Collection lowers the need for water.
                decreases the demand for water imports. encourages energy and
                water conservation. increases groundwater availability and
                quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Soil erosion, flooding, drought, and other problems can be
                prevented by using permaculture to build your land and by
                understanding where water flows through your property.
              </p>
              <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
              <p>
                The effective management of RWH techniques and concern over the
                prudent use of water resources have a significant chance of
                reducing climatic hazards in the dry Zones. In order to maximise
                efficiency and intake capacity, RWH performs best when combined
                with other management techniques like tillage, fertiliser
                management, weeding, time of sowing, and crop cycles. To develop
                and spread RWH technologies that are more efficient and
                economical as alternatives, as well as to design and create
                alternative policy instruments and social institutions that
                support the adoption of RWH practises, there is a need to offer
                training and extension services.
