                            Let's look in more detail how these understated devices execute their wonders. Piezometers work on the hydrostatic pressure principle, which describes the pressure that a fluid exerts when it is in a balance at any given position. The water column inside the piezometer experiences pressure as a result of changes in groundwater levels. Engineers, geologists, and environmentalists can learn a great deal about the depth and behavior of groundwater by measuring this pressure.
