                            <p>
                            It's that time of the year when the heavens start pouring in and you start thinking of conserving this precious water. If you live in an area that gets lots of rain annually, start looking for ways to save this salt-free source that you can use for watering plants, cleaning floors and washing utensils. Rainwater harvesting involves collecting water directly from the surface on which it falls, like a courtyard or terrace of a building or an unpaved region like an open ground or lawn. Here, we will have a look at 10 best ways to save rain water.

                            <ul style={{ "listStyleType" : "decimal" }}>
                                <li>
                                    <h2 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
                                    <p><a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/">Rooftop rainwater harvesting</a> involves creating a small channel which connects rainwater on the rooftop to a storage tank. Further, filters are installed to keep stored rain water hygienic and clean. The stored rainwater in the catchment area of the roof is either transferred to an artificial recharge system or a tank. The filter separates all kinds of debris and dirt from the water effectively.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h2 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Making a Rain Saucer</h2>
                                    <p>If you are looking for a simple and easy way to collect rainwater, a rain water saucer is the perfect solution. It is an unbound rainwater collecting structure featuring an upper portion that looks like an upside-down umbrella that consists of a funnel to collect rainwater and store it into the below-connected barrel.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h2 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Creating a Rain Garden</h2>
                                    <p>One of the easiest ways of storing rainwater, a rain garden is basically a small sunken landscape in the garden that uses local soil and mulch, along with native plants to remove water contaminants. It allows rainwater to further percolate into the ground to recharge groundwater.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h2 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Installing a Rain Barrel</h2>
                                    <p>Rain barrels can be anything that serves as a rainwater storing container, like an empty drum or trash can. You must connect the unit to a pipe to transfer water from the rooftop into it. Ensure covering it with a tight-fitting top while screening the ends of the downspouts leading to the barrels to prevent the container from becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes and insects.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h2 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Making a Rain Chain</h2>
                                    <p>With an added benefit of improving home d√©cor, rain chains are fun and fashionable accessories that help to avoid runoffs by transferring rainwater from collecting pipes to a storage container or drain. You can make this environment-friendly accessory by using just a few basic tools, like small mugs and buckets, spoons, holders and vintage materials.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h2 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Setting Up a Splash Block</h2>
                                    <p>Another easy way of collecting rainwater on the rooftop is using a splash block that directs rainwater to a storage medium. A splash block is a small piece of plastic or concrete in rectangular shape, placed below the down spot that carries rainwater from the roof to the storage tank. The splash block diverts the direction of water by absorbing its force.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Recharging Borewells and Wells Naturally</h3>
                                    <p>It is possible to recharge borewells and wells naturally by digging a pit that pushes rainwater into these groundwater systems. 6 meter deep and one meter in diameter, these pits can be lined with perforated concrete rings that allow de-silted and filtered water to seep from the sides and get to the groundwater table.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Constructing an Underground Reservoir</h3>
                                    <p>One of the most sustainable solutions, an underground reservoir is connected to a pipe so the water can be directly used for watering gardens and washing cars. This also helps to minimize the use of existing groundwater.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Water Tanks</h3>
                                    <p>Buildings in gated communities can use water tanks to store thousands of gallons of water. Not primarily made of plastic, these tanks can either be in the form of subterranean or above-ground water tanks positioned on a firm ground.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<h4 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Green Roof Systems</h4>
                                    <p>Also called living roofs, green roof systems regulate storm water runoff by delaying or slowing water flow. They also filter rainwater and also require installing a liner for roof and drainage system protection.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
