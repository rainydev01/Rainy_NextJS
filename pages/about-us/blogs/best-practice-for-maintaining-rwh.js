                  A Beginner's Guide to setting up a Rainwater Harvesting
                  System.
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Rainwater harvesting is the greatest method or technology for
                  conserving rainwater by gathering, storing, transporting, and
                  purifying rainwater that runs off rooftops, hill slopes,
                  parks, roadways, and open areas for later use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Water shortages have become a major cause for concern in our
                  lives. So, by preserving rainwater, which is pure and of high
                  quality, it may be utilised for a variety of purposes, such as
                  plant irrigation, washing and cleaning, bathing, cooking, and
                  other animal needs. Everything needs some upkeep to stay in
                  excellent shape, which is true for tools, relationships,
                  automobiles, homes, and rainwater collection systems. You're
                  effectively running your utility when you live on rainwater
                  (i.e., rainfall systems that give residents drinking water).
                  You'll want to ensure it provides the best water quality for
                  you and your family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The good news is that maintaining a rainwater harvesting
                  system is straightforward and generally inexpensive.

                <ul style={{ listStyle: "bullet" }}>
                  <li>
                    A catchment is used to collect and store the captured
                    rainwater in the gutter.

                  <li>
                    Conveyance system: Downspout pipes transport the collected
                    water from the catchment to the recharge zone.

                  <li>
                    Flush: It is used to flush out the dirt from the first spell
                    of rain.

                  <li>
                    Filter: used for filtering the harvested rainwater and
                    removing pollutants and dirt.

                <p>
                  Starting with the beginning of a rainwater catchment
                  system—the roof and gutters—and moving down the conveyance
                  line to the disinfection station, the rainy filter, and
                  finally to the storage facility (sump, open wells, or bore
                  wells).
                </p>
                <ul style={{ listStyle: "bullet" }}>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Check roof & Gutters</h5>
                    <p>
                      Roof - As dust or dirt collects on top, wash it with water
                      to redirect runoff from the tank entrance. Monthly,
                      especially after lengthy dry weather or strong winds.
                      During the wet season, keep an eye out for leaf litter
                      collection. Brush away leaf litter regularly, especially
                      after strong gusts and shortly before rains. Trim
                      overhanging trees surrounding the roof more frequently.
                      Repair the roof damage (broken tiles, cracked
                      waterproofing, etc.) early and before the rainy season. If
                      there is rust, use lead-free paint to paint it once a
                      year.

                      bottom attached to the roof's edge to collect rainwater.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Clear up bird droppings, leaves, and other debris with
                      water. Inspect monthly, especially after long dry weather
                      or high winds. During the wet season, check every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Inspect and repair gutters and downspouts. Inspect for
                      leaks or obstructions caused by debris build-up, and clean
                      the gutters when necessary.

                    <p>
                      Wipe down the leaf guards and clean out the gutters and
                      roof. Fine dust particles, for example, do not need to be
                      completely removed from the top because your sediment
                      filter will manage them.

                      pooling, filth, trash etc., during the installation and

                      Rainy developed an HDPE Push-N-Lock Type interlocking
                      coupling system with a union that provides a simple yet
                      secure connection.We created the sealing rings from rubber
                      and polypropylene to keep the links leak proof. Together
                      with pipes with a typical length of 6 metres and an inlet
                      size of 90-110 MM, we manufacture push-n-lock type tees,
                      bends, reducers, and end plugs to round out the range.
                      Extending the life of the pipes, fittings, and overall
                      system, the pipes and fittings are made with HDPE resin,
                      grey master batch, and UV stabilizer additives.

                  <li>
                    <h5>First Flush Devices</h5>
                    <p>
                      After the potable filter installation, we also perform a
                      first flush to lessen the quantity of sediment that enters
                      your storage tank. These first flushes are often a pipe
                      run that terminates with a screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Remove the little screen and rinse. We recommend cleaning
                      the first flush screen on the same days you change your
                      filters and inspecting after major weather events, such as
                      before and after the rainy season and after each rooftop
                      cleaning session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Instead of a first flush, your system may use an
                      eliminator tank. If this is the case, make sure the
                      eliminator drains automatically when full or manually
                      drains regularly to guarantee flush capacity during the
                      next rain.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Open Ended, Non-ClogFilters</h5>
                    <p>
                      Rainy filters eliminate the above-mentioned maintenance
                      requirements and aid in auto-flushing and self-cleaning.
                      When rainwater, dirt, and debris flow through the downtake
                      pipes by gravity, they enter the filter and begin rotating
                      in an anticlockwise direction at the periphery of the
                      upper housing, allowing them to flow into the SS-304
                      filter element placed in the lower housing in angular
                      motion at a specific speed and velocity.

                    <h5>How to clean Rainy Filters?</h5>
                    <p>
                      In the event that the filter element is clogged or if
                      there is an excessive amount of water escaping through the
                      drain outlet, the filter element must be replaced. Simply
                      remove the SS-304 filter element from the filter and clean
                      it with the provided brush under running water. Use a
                      water source with high pressure to thoroughly clean the
                      filter element if it remains clogged. Please note that
                      light must pass through the filter mesh to indicate that
                      it has been properly cleaned; this enables the filter to
                      operate at a very high level of efficiency. If the issues
                      persist, please contact our technical support staff.

                    <p>
                      Usually, cleaning the inside of a tank is required every
                      15-20 years to remove any accumulated silt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Every ten years, before and after the rainy season, empty
                      and clean the tank. Check the tank's stability, the
                      cover's good fit, the absence of leaks, and the
                      accumulation of debris. Repair any leaks. Remove any
                      nearby tree roots (if the tank is underground) as soon as
