                            <p>
                            Rainwater, the solution of life, it is a precious resource that sustains every living thing on our planet. It is the essence of existence, yet it is a finite resource. As there is an increase in the population and urbanization, the demand for the water also increases, while our natural water sources are also facing depletion and pollution. So, what is the solution? Well, there is a hidden solution from the nature-rainwater. And it is a time to access this liquid gold through the practice of rainwater harvesting.
                            </p>

                            Now we came to know about the importance of rainwater harvesting, let’s dive more on how it all works. At its core, rainwater harvesting is all about collecting rainwater and storing it for the various purposes. Here is simplified process of rainwater harvesting,

                                    <p><h4 style={{ "fontSize": "17px" }}>Collection:</h4> Rainwater is collected from the roof’s, pavements or other catchment surfaces. This can be done using the gutters and downspouts, which directs the rainwater into a storage tank.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><h4 style={{ "fontSize": "17px" }}>Filtration:</h4> Before storing, the collected rainwater may need to be filtered to remove the debris and contaminants. This is usually done through a series of filter or the screens.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><h4 style={{ "fontSize": "17px" }}>Storage:</h4> The filtered rainwater can be stored in tanks. These can be above ground, like large barrels or underground for more significant storage.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><h5 style={{ "fontSize": "15px" }}>Rain Barrels:</h5> Rain barrels are the simplest and most cost-effective way to collect rainwater. They are typically placed under downspouts to catch rainwater running off the roof. You can also use this harvested water for watering your garden or the other outdoor chores.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p><h5 style={{ "fontSize": "15px" }}>Dry Systems:</h5> These systems are similar to rain barrels but use a dry pipe system. They are particularly useful in the areas with less rainfall and work well for small-scale collection.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><h5 style={{ "fontSize": "15px" }}>Wet systems:</h5> Wet systems involve directing rainwater from the roof into a storage tank which can be located below the ground. These systems are ideal for areas with more rainfall and can provide a subsequent water supply.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><h5 style={{ "fontSize": "15px" }}>Green roofs:</h5> Green roofs, also known as living roofs, use a layer of vegetation to absorb rainwater and reduces the runoff. They not only help with rainwater harvesting but also provide insulation and support biodiversity.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
