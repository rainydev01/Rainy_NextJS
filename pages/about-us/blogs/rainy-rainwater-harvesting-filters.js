                <h1>Rainy Rain Water Harvesting systems</h1>
                <p>
                  Rainwater harvesting systems are one of the best methods
                  practiced and followed to support the conservation of water.
                  It collects and stores rain rather than allowing it to run
                  off. Rainwater, which is pure in form and of good quality, can
                  be used for watering gardens, washing, cleaning, bathing,
                  cooking, irrigation, and domestic uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although rain is one of the cleanest water sources, every drop
                  results from condensation around airborne dust, clay,
                  chemical, or salt particles. Hence, it should be filtered
                  before it is kept in a tank. This is done to maintain it in
                  the best possible shape and prevent biological material from
                  degrading, developing odors, and turning discolored, among
                  other things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The roof and gutters of a building are not sterile
                  environments. Therefore, rainwater will pick up moss, dirt,
                  leaves, bird faeces, etc. on its way to the tank. It is,
                  therefore, essential to install an effective pre-tank
                  filtration system and, in some cases, additional treatment to
                  ensure that the stored rainwater can be used effectively and
                  safely.
                </p>

                <h5>10 Reasons Why You Need Rainwater Harvesting Filter</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Helps in collecting rainwater</li>
                  <p>
                    When we first started collecting rainwater on our roofs or
                    in percolation tanks, we didn't trust the water to be
                    drinkable in its raw form. It seemed safe to drink the
                    rainwater, and to some extent, it was safe. But since then,
                    the times have changed and, more significantly, the
                    surroundings have changed. The impurities present in the
                    stored water include algae, air pollution, bird droppings,
                    leaves, sand, and dust. Therefore, filtering and
                    disinfection methods are required if the gathered water is
                    to be used for household purposes.
                  </p>
                  <li>Rainy's dual intensity</li>
                  <p>
                    filters work at high efficiency regardless of the intensity
                    of rainfall, have self-cleaning abilities, are
                    maintenance-free, and are rooftop rainwater harvesting
                    filters.
                  </p>

                  <li>THE PUSH-N-LOCK HDPE PIPING SYSTEM(portable)</li>
                  <p>
                    High-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes have, over the
                    decades, proven their capabilities as the ideal form of
                    piping for various water management applications. However,
                    there have been very few jointing techniques that offer an
                    easy yet robust installation experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We created an HDPE Push-N-Lock Type interlocking coupling
                    system with a union that provides a simple yet secure
                    connection. Along with the pipes, which have a standard
                    length of 6 meters, we manufacture push-n-lock type tees,
                    bends, reducers, and end plugs to complete the range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pipes and fittings are manufactured using HDPE resin,
                    grey master batch, and UV stabiliser additives to increase
                    the life of the pipes, fittings, and overall system. To keep
                    the joints leakproof, we have designed the sealing rings
                    using rubber and polypropylene.
                  </p>

                  <li>UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY(non-clogging filter</li>
                  <p>
                    The filter assembly is an open-ended system that keeps water
                    and solid particles from getting stuck in one place. Its
                    unique working principles enable self-cleaning, eliminating
                    the need for frequent manual cleaning. The unique design of
                    the push-and-lock coupling mechanism makes it easy to
                    establish leak proof connections.
                  </p>
                  <li>Various Applications</li>
                  <p>
                    Works on the principles of cohesion and centrifugal force at
                    low and high intensities of rainfall, respectively. Does not
                    need external energy because it relies only on gravitational
                    forces.

                  <li>HIGH EFFICIENCY</li>
                  <p>
                    Achieves efficiencies over 90%, irrespective of rainfall
                    intensities. Filters water efficiently, even during
                    torrential rains. It indirectly reduces the power consumed
                    in pumping and checks overexploitation of groundwater by
                    establishing water neutrality.

                  <p>
                    It can be accommodated anywhere, whether wall-mounted under
                    low-lying roofs or ducts. Filter connections can be turned
                    360 degrees to suit the site conditions.

                  <p>
                    Highly durable yet made of food-grade and recyclable
                    materials; built with tough, high-density UV-treated
                    polyethylene housing featuring a multilayer stainless steel
                    screen filter element.

                  <li>Value For Money</li>
                  <p>
                    These long-lasting filters significantly cut down on water
                    bills by saving free rainwater. Additionally, the aeration
                    process during swirling water movement improves water
                    quality.
                  </p>
                  <li>Easy To Install</li>
                  <p>
                    Simple installation procedure backed by a detailed
                    instruction manual such that any local plumber with minimal
                    experience is sufficient for installation.
                  </p>
                </ol>

                <h5>Why did conventional filters fail</h5>
                <p>
                  The mechanical filters are designed with the gate wall system
                  at the drain side. When the dirt particles enter the filter,
                  the dirt and debris enter the filter housing assembly. The
                  filter candle needs to be cleaned by opening the valve
                  manually. The most significant drawback of these systems is
                  their need for periodic maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because clogging is hard to predict and rain is hard to
                  predict, this system has a lot of problems. This results in
                  debris clogging inside the filter and chances of decay, water
                  contamination, and overflowing of water through the filter or
                  terrace area, resulting in unsafe water flow to the
                  surrounding environment.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="bolg-info">
                <h5>Conventional filters vs Rainy filters</h5>
                <p>
                  The major drawbac kobserved in conventional filters is the
                  clogging of dirt, debris, and leaves inside the filter housing
                  assembly and the lack of an automatic flushing system, which
                  calls for frequent manual cleaning. This might lead to decay,
                  water contamination, and overflow into the terrace area.
                  Conventional filters cannot handle torrential rains, leading
                  to an undue waste of precious water. Setting the direction of
                  the inlet and outlet as per site conditions is not possible
                  with conventional fixed coupling filters. Common disadvantages
                  are high head requirements, a tedious installation process,
                  limited roof area coverage, etc.

                    Rainwater harvesting helps individuals save on their water
                    bills, and the cost to supply the mains and overall water
                    services can be substantially reduced when many people in
