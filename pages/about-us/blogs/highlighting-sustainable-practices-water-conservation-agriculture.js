                            <p>
                            A crucial topic that impacts both the sustainability of food production and the health of our world is <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/about-us/blogs/ancient-method-vs-modern-technology">water conservation in agriculture</a>. 70% of the freshwater used worldwide is used for agriculture, and as the world's population rises, so will the need for food, further taxing our finite water supplies. There is a limited supply of fresh water available, around 2.5 percent, and most of it is utilised for farming purposes. Global food security is at risk due to groundwater depletion.
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, India uses around 245 billion cubic metres of groundwater yearly, of which 90% is used for agriculture. The outflow of groundwater is thus far greater than the intake. The administration knows that the image is far worse than it looks to the unaided eye. Soil consumption will put further strain on freshwater resources and agricultural land. Therefore, farmers are currently employing cutting-edge methods to preserve water, supported by technology in agriculture, which will soon make sustainable agriculture viable.</p>

                            <h3>Drip irrigation</h3>
                            <p>
                            The most effective method of giving crops the water and nutrients they need for healthy development is drip irrigation. With this technique, exact amounts of nutrients and water are delivered at the appropriate times to each plant's root zone. Consequently, farmers may use less water, fertiliser, and energy to produce larger yields. Drip irrigation maximises the efficiency of water and fertiliser utilisation in agriculture by enabling focused and exact resource delivery. It also reduces waste.

                            <p>
                            These farms can still benefit from gathering and storing rainwater as a strategy to save water supplies, even if they might not receive enough rain to meet all of their irrigation demands. Reclaiming water helps lessen the environmental impact that farms, no matter how big or little, might have. This can be a beneficial water-saving measure if the farm receives regular rain and has the resources to purify the water if it will be used for irrigation as well as drinking.

                            <p>
                            Irrigation system managers use irrigation schedules to establish the proper frequency and length of watering. Water management considers when, how, and how much to apply, in addition to the technique of irrigation. Farmers keep an eye on plant conditions, soil moisture levels, and weather forecasts in order to modify their irrigation plans and avoid over- or under-watering their crops.
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition to preventing water waste and possible detrimental effects on plant health and production, this proactive strategy helps optimise the use of water by ensuring that crops receive the appropriate amount of water at the correct time for optimal development.</p>

                            <h4>Laser Field Leveling</h4>
                            <p>
                            Since the fields or gardens where you're planted aren't precisely level, any water that doesn't sink into the soil instantly rushes away, making runoff one of the primary sources of water waste. By utilising lasers and other instruments to level the field properly before planting crops, laser land levelling lowers or even eliminates the issue of runoff. This indirectly prevents waste and encourages conservation.

                            <p>
                            You are not left with a lot of runoff to cope with if laser levelling is a possibility. In the agricultural sector, this discharge is referred to as tailwater, and it may be collected and utilised again for irrigation. This is especially helpful in the organic farming industry, as there won't be any concerns about extra chemicals building up in the tailwater. For this, all you'll need is a ditch or buried container to catch the runoff and a method to transfer it back to your irrigation system.

                            <p>
                            Organic farming is a collection of agricultural techniques that emphasise the use of natural methods and materials to improve soil fertility, minimise dependency on synthetic chemicals, and preserve water. Crop rotation, for example, helps to vary the crops planted in a field over time, lowering the danger of nutrient depletion and insect infestation while also fostering healthier soils that can retain more water.

                            Water conservation in agriculture is becoming increasingly essential for both environmental health and agricultural viability. Farmers may optimise water consumption, increase crop yields, and promote long-term agricultural sustainability by implementing the practices outlined above. These strategies allow farmers to increase yields while using less water, fertiliser, and energy. It is critical to acknowledge the value of water conservation in agriculture in order to secure a sustainable future for everybody.
