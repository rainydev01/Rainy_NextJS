                            <p>
                            With 2.2 million people in the USA lacking safe drinking water, itâ€™s time to start making use of best water conservation systems USA. This involves saving usable fresh water to continue living on this planet while managing everyday tasks, like cleaning, cooking and bathing conveniently. At Rainy Filters, we do this efficiently by providing systems and components for rainwater harvesting, one of the best ways to conserve water. Keep reading to know more about this technology.

                            <h2>Rainwater Treatment for Water Conservation</h2>
                            <p>The process of collecting rainwater and further treating it to get dirt & debris-free water for varied purposes is called rainwater harvesting. For effective rainwater harvesting, use our innovative technology featuring varied components, like dual-intensity filters, to collect fresh rainwater, either in simple barrels or large collection systems. Our flexible technology also enables you to use other rainwater harvesting techniques like dams, underground tanks, water collection reservoirs and rain saucers.</p>

                            <h2>Discover Our Patented Technology on Conserving Water</h2>
                            <p>We have taken <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/about-us/blogs/rain-water-harvesting-in-different-countries">ground water harvesting in USA</a> to the next level by using key technology and innovation to harvest rainwater, the purest source of water with less than 50mg/litre of TDS or Total Dissolved Solids. Our minimalistic and easy to install and maintain filters and groundwater recharge systems reduce carbon footprint and recharge water sources to get clean water for everyday use.</p>

                            <p>Our system for rooftop rainwater harvesting in USA is one of the most sophisticated solutions in the market. It is capable of harvesting average 200, 000 litres of filtered water for an average rainfall of 800 MM per year over a 250 sq. m rooftop. You can use it to store water in a sump for re-utilisation. This can help meet almost 35% of the annual requirement of water in a household further saving on power and water bill. Besides reducing dependency on corporation water, groundwater and water tankers, our system checks the over-exploitation of different groundwater sources.</p>

                            <p>Working on Gravitational Principle, our rainwater harvesting technology also reduces water pumping from depths and distant places and prevents water logging in low-lying regions. Cost-effective and compact in size, this water conservation system does not require consumables. Other exclusive features include built-in self-cleaning mechanism and tough UV stabilised high density polyethylene structure.</p>

                            <p>You can further reap benefits like flexibility in pipe connection to any angle, automatic flush out of debris and dirt and multi-surface screen food grade filter element. Simple in connection, the filter efficiency in our rainwater harvesting system remains unchanged even with variations in rainfall intensity. You can also turn up the filter pipe connection up to 360 degree to suit given site conditions. Not to mention the swirling water movement due to our filters that causes aeration and further improves water quality.</p>

                            <h2>Our Rainwater Harvesting Procedure</h2>
                            <p>Our rainwater harvesting procedure features a few simple steps as follows:</p>

                            <ul style={{ "marginTop": "50px", "listStyleType": "disc" }}>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Rainwater, along with debris and dirt, flows by gravitational force through down pipes and enters into our filters.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>It rotates in anticlockwise direction, enabling water to flow into filter element in angular motion at specific velocity and speed.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>This creates centrifugal force at high intensity and cohesive force at low-intensity rainfall, flushing out debris and dirt automatically.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Next, clean water passes through the drain outlet and is diverted into the recharge well or sump through the clean water outlet.</p>
