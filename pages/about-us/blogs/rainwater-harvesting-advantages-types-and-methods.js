                    <h1>Rainwater Harvesting Advantages Types And Methods</h1>
                    <p>
                      Rainwater harvesting is a valuable term for
                      self-sufficiency, household water, combating water
                      scarcity, and a broad business term for the future. By
                      collecting and treating rain and stormwater from roofs and
                      ground surfaces, water availability for human consumption
                      increases exponentially without putting undue strain on
                      other sources of primary water supply. Rainwater becomes
                      an infinite resource and a life-giving gift from nature
                      when precise scientific measurements are used. Rainwater
                      harvesting is one of the simplest and oldest methods of
                      self-supplying water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rainwater harvesting enabled us to find innovative
                      solutions to the crisis. Rainwater is safe for consumption
                      or domestic use, with no long-term negative consequences.
                      Rainwater harvesting provides a cost-effective and
                      irrefutable answer to the call for water conservation
                      without disrupting the hydrologic cycle as modern methods
                      of recycling waste water for human consumption become more
                      expensive. Rainwater should be collected and stored in
                      supply drains for future use. Rainwater is commonly used
                      in gardening, crop irrigation, livestock care, residential
                      heating, and water treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Furthermore, one can collect as much rainwater as one
                      wants without fear of being taxed or penalized (just make
                      sure it isn't breeding mosquitoes). Rainwater is
                      salt-free, chlorine-free, calcium-free, and lime-free, and
                      its pH level is slightly below 7. Rainwater harvesting
                      technology that is appropriate will reduce the
                      environmental footprint while also lowering the water
                      costs for every household.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      Rainwater collection can be used for personal or
                      commercial purposes.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      1. Individual rainwater harvesting systems involve
                      collecting rain or storm water in barrels or tarpaulins
                      and channelling it to water storage tanks or a well with
                      or without filtration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      2. Commercial rainwater harvesting differs from how water
                      is collected and distributed, i.e. (rainwater collected
                      goes to shafts, boreholes, barrels, aquifers, underground
                      vaults, and water reservoirs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rainwater is collected from rivers or roofs and redirected
                      to a deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), a reservoir via
                      percolation, or collected from dew or fog using nets or
                      other tools in many places. Some of its applications
                      include water for gardens, livestock, irrigation, domestic
                      use with proper treatment, indoor heating for houses, and
                      so on.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      Water collection, supply, and redistribution in rainwater
                      harvesting consist of four stages:
                    </h4>
                    <li>i. Collecting Rainwater:</li>
                    <p>
                      capturing rainfall or stormwater from a home's or other
                      building's roof and drainpipes. The greater the size of
                      the roof, the more water can be collected.
                    </p>
                    <li> Filtration:</li>
                    <p>
                      {" "}
                      It is a common misconception that rainwater is clean and
                      free of toxins. Despite the fact that rainwater is not
                      collected for drinking water, studies show that good
                      rainwater harvesting systems must go through a filtration
                      process to ensure it is free of debris and certain
                      contaminants.
                    </p>
                    <li> Storage:</li>
                    <p>
                      All rainwater harvesting systems require storage space and
                      containment.
                    </p>
                    <li>Redistribution:</li>
                    <p>
                      Effective use of stored rainwater can be redistributed
                      wherever it is intended to be used to the greatest extent,
                      such as gardens, crops, RO purifiers, valleys, downspouts
                      to underground shafts, storage tanks, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rainwater harvesting methods are broadly classified into
                      the following categories.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                      1. Rainwater harvesting systems that are directly pumped
                      (Submersible)
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      Water collected into the underground tanks has to go
                      through required filtration systems before being
                      redistributed via a direct-pump harvesting system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      {" "}
                      This system is typically simple to install and is
                      primarily used in the home. Water enters the tank via
                      gravity or a pump or both, and is then redistributed from
                      the tank to household appliances via another pump. The
                      directly pumped rainwater harvesting system is known as a
                      "submersible direct pumped rainwater harvesting system."
                      If the pump is located near the appliances and draws water
                      from the tank, the system is also known as a "suction
                      direct pumped rainwater harvesting system."

                      Storage areas must be located on the surface or in a less
                      deep underground area on your property rather than fully
                      underground. Water can be restored in multiple tanks, both
                      underground and inside the building. The advantage of
                      pumping water using a hydraulic or electric motor with a
                      pressurized flow is that it provides great flexibility and
                      ease of maintenance, as well as control over how much
                      rainwater is collected.

                    <p>
                      Indirect gravity systems contain storage tanks placed at
                      the elevated areas of your property. They are most
                      commonly located above the building's roof. The rainwater
                      collected from the roof and drains gets redirected to the
                      tank via a pump, but it can be redistributed from the tank
                      via gravity. Because this system only needs to pump the
                      water once, you can save a lot of energy.

                    <p>
                      These are the most cost-effective and energy-efficient
                      rainwater harvesting systems available. Gravity-only
                      harvesting systems rely only on gravity to collect
                      rainwater from roofs by simply placing containments or
                      barrels beneath the drainpipes connected to water capture
                      from rooftops. It should also be set up so that the water
                      tank is higher than the surface level of the appliances to
                      which it must supply and redistribute water. Gravity-only
                      systems are most commonly used by homeowners who want
                      water for gardening or whose living space is limited to
                      only the ground floor.

                    <h5>The Advantages of Rainwater Harvesting</h5>
                    <p>
                      1. Creates a living culture that encourages people to be
                      conservative by identifying and controlling their
                      individual or household water usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      2. Rainwater harvesting helps to realize effective water
                      management. “We should not only deal with the problem
                      caused by floods, but it should also provide for
                      irrigation, electricity, and navigation,” said the doyen
                      and visionary behind National Water Grid, ‘The Water Man
                      of India’ Dr. Ambedkar. He considered water cannot to be a
                      curse or a rare commodity. Water has to be the wealth of
                      the nation. With rainwater, harvesting states can be able
                      to handle water needs on their own. Thus, it leads to the
                      gradual transition from a dependent to a self-sufficient
                      economy.

                      3. There is no scarcity of changing seasons because there
                      is always enough water in storage and ready for

                      4. To maintain groundwater levels, and reduce surface
                      water contamination with pesticides, sediment, metals, and
                      fertilizers.

                    <p>
                      5. Reduces the velocity of flow in local creeks, streams,
                      and rivers following heavy rainfall or storms, reducing
                      the potential for soil erosion.

                    <p>
                      6. Reduces water clogging in streets, roads, and so on. It
                      prevents pollution, contamination, and the spread of
                      water-borne diseases.

                    <p>
                      8. Reduces energy consumption and mining requirements, as
                      well as provides control over the impact of natural
                      disasters.

                    <p>
                      9. Act as a backup provider for heavy water needs in
                      manufacturing processes.

                    <p>
                      10. While governments struggle to meet citizens’, water
                      needs by building new dams, extending underground pipes,
                      and establishing new water treatment plants, citizens, on
                      the other hand, faces difficulties due to increased
                      billing dates and rising prices in the economy. In terms
                      of cheaper water storage, rainwater harvesting is a
                      blessing for both parties.

                      11. Rescuer during emergency situations within a property
                      or industrial premises (in the event of a fire) because
                      water is readily available and convenient

                        Rainwater harvesting enables us to benefit from the
                        stormwater retention regulations. It not only aids in
                        groundwater recharge, but it also allows for the storage
                        of captured water at the micro-to-macro level without
                        incurring any burning costs. Rainwater proves to be a
                        top-notch option for potable irrigation and commercial
                        purposes too.
