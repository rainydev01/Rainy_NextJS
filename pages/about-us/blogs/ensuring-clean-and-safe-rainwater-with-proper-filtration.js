                            <p>
                            Rainwater is a precious resource that can be collected, cleaned, and used for a variety of purposes. It can also be used for drinking, but only after a thorough cleaning to get rid of the dirt, germs, and pollutants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Collected rainwater can contain bacteria, viruses, chemicals, etc., especially in urban regions. Choosing the right rainwater filtration method is vital to ensuring clean and safe results.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Steps to Clean Rainwater</h2>
                            <p>
                            Rainwater collection and filtration is much more than placing a random container or digging a pit. It is a systematic process with multiple steps. While you can use DIY home filtration systems like sand, gravel, etc., they may not be effective.
                            </p>
                            <ul style={{ "listStyleType" : "disc" }}>
                                <li>
                                    <h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Collect Rainwater in a Clean Container</h3>
                                    <p>Use a clean container, preferably a metal pot (non-rusty), to collect the rainwater rushing through the drainpipes from the roof. A pit will also do, but keep it clean and free of dirt and have a plumbing system to transport the rainwater to another place/ pot.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Sedimentation</h3>
                                    <p>While there are various <a href="https://www.rainyfilters.com/about-us/blogs/types-of-filter">rainwater filtration</a> techniques like roof washers, first flush diverters, sand filters, etc., itâ€™s up to you to choose the most convenient method based on the property layout, amount of rainwater collected, and budget.</p>
                                    <p>Sedimentation is the easiest way. Let the collected rainwater sit idle for a few hours/ days. The particles will sink and settle at the bottom, leaving clear water above. However, you still need to filter this water to remove tiny particles that don't sink.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Active Carbon Filtration</h3>
                                    <p>Active carbon filtration is the latest method to remove chemicals, viruses, and bacteria from rainwater. The collected water is passed through a layer of carbon filter (charcoal), which separates the impurities. Though this technique is expensive, it is highly effective than other filtration methods. The filters should be replaced periodically.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Reverse Osmosis (RO)</h3>
                                    <p>Reverse osmosis is another filtration method that uses membrane-based filtration to remove bacteria, minerals, dissolving solids, etc., from rainwater. The semi-permeable membrane filters used in RO allow smaller water molecules to pass through and block the larger ones with impurities. RO filtration is also used for groundwater purification with excessive minerals like lime.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Ultraviolet (UV) Purification for Disinfection</h3>
                                    <p>Despite the filtration, the collected rainwater will still have invisible bacteria and viruses that can cause water-borne diseases. UV purification is necessary and should not be ignored. UV light is powerful and kills the microorganisms and harmful pathogens in rainwater. A device with high-intensity UV light is used for this purpose.</p>
                                    <p>It is a chemical-free process that kills the microorganisms and makes rainwater safe enough for consumption. In the case of extremely polluted rainwater, you can combine UV light and other disinfection techniques to purify the water as much as possible.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h3 style={{ "fontSize": "20px" }}>Chlorination</h3>
                                    <p>Chlorination is a common disinfection method for eliminating microorganisms from different types of water. The water supplied by the government municipal bodies is disinfected by adding chlorine in a fixed ratio. Additionally, you can boil the water on a high for five minutes to kill the bacteria and viruses. Test the water quality before consuming it.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
