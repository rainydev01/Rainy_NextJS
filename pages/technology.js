                                  Systems in the year 2002 was significantly
                                  upgraded in the year 2007 due to constant
                                  research & development, both at the state of

                                  and at the field level. This technology is
                                  unique in many ways. It uses Gravitational
                                  Energy and the use of eco-friendly materials
                                  having a long-life span. The technology has
                                  gained wide spread acceptance by various
                                  Government Organizations in the State of
                                  Karnataka in Districts and Taluks which are
                                  highly drought prone, because of the positive

                                  filtration media consisting of crushed stone,

                                  bottom of the recharge well. The rain water is
                                  led through a water channel and first reaches
                                  the silt trap, which allows for silt to settle
                                  down in the chamber. The overflow water is led

                                  creates a water column. The percolator pipe,
                                  attached to the non-clogging FL V-wire screen,
                                  is placed by boring through the permeable

                                  meters below the ground level. The water then
                                  passes through the permeable strata by gravity
                                  and reaches the dry joints, cracks, weathered

                                  groundwater. The water also gets filtered
                                  while passing through the permeable strata.

                                  Due to the installations of FL V-wire
                                  Injection Wells in many of the severely
                                  drought prone areas across the country, the
                                  groundwater table has significantly improved.
                                  The intervention through FL V-wire Injection
                                  Well technology led to hundreds of bore wells
                                  which had water tables more than 1000 feet
                                  below ground level being recharged to half
                                  their levels (450 to 500 feet). Due to acute
                                  shortage of power during the peak summer
                                  season, a vast majority of the farmers resort
                                  to diesel generators to pump out water. The
                                  energy requirement to pump out the water is
                                  directly proportional to the static head and
                                  quantum of water discharged, thereby
                                  significantly lowering the required pump
                                  capacity, with increase in water table and
                                  thus reduction in carbon emission.

                                  actively seeking their counsel in establishing
                                  a set of frameworks to develop relevant
                                  standards and benchmarks in the field of
                                  groundwater recharge. The implementation of FL
                                  V-wire technology has resulted in the
                                  rejuvenation of bore wells in peak summer
                                  months, thereby reducing the need for water
                                  supply through water tankers. In other
                                  instances, there is a remarkable improvement
                                  in the qualitative aspect of the water. The
                                  innovation provides twin benefits - it aids
                                  water recharge in dry and arid regions by
                                  addressing water requirements of a large
                                  section of society and also helps in avoiding
                                  new bore wells, need for tanker water and
                                  energy for water extraction. These help in
                                  obtaining a net positive carbon footprint and
                                  local community adaptation to water stress.
                                  The scalability of the innovation and its
                                  co-benefits has wider applicability in the

                                    Unique Slot Structure: Owing to the unique
                                    design of the screen, which enables slots to
                                    be present horizontally and vertically there
                                    is continual flow without any interruption.

                                    Higher Filtration: Due to the slot-based
                                    approach of the v-wire technology, we are
                                    able to choose the size of the slots
                                    depending on the media around / in which it
                                    is going to be placed. This allows for high

                                    particles allowing for good control over

                                    ensures that no sand or other particles get
                                    clogged in the system. This unique V shape
                                    results in the screen having a long
