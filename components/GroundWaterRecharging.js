              <p>
                â€˜V-wire injection well' technology is used to recharge
                groundwater source and replenish the water table. Run off
                rainwater is made to pass into a silt trap through a channel and
                then to an injection well. Here, it goes through multiple
                filtration media and is eventually passed on to a specially
                designed storage well. The storage well has dual non clogging
                V-Wire screens attached to a percolator pipe. The clean water is
                then made to percolate into deep layers of the earth's strata,
                ultimately recharging the groundwater source and replenishing
                the water table.
